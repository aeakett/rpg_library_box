<h2>Level (Lvl)</h2>
<p>Start at level 1.</p>
<h2>Hit Points (HP)</h2>
<p>How much damage a PC can take.</p>
<h2>Special Abilities</h2>
<p>Fighters and Professionals choose one Special Ability at 1st level.</p>
<p>Psionics choose one Psionic Power at 1st level.</p>

<h2>Combat Specialty</h2>

<h1>Skill Checks</h1>
<p>The GM determines the difficulty of any tasks the PCs might encounter and has them roll a skill check:</p>
<p>1d20+applicable background (if any)+applicable attribute+level ≥ difficulty.</p>

<h1>The GM’s Helper</h1>
<p>A favorable condition grants a +2 to a roll or defense attribute. Use sparingly, except for cover. Allow cover liberally.</p>
<h1>Combat</h1>
<p>A round of combat is 6 seconds long.</p>
<p>On your turn you may:<ul>
<li>Move and make an attack.</li>
<li>Move and use a psionic power.</li>
<li>Move and make a skill check.</li>
<li>Disengage from melee (see below).</li>
<li>Run to Far range.</li></ul></p>
<h2>Movement</h2>
<p>If you are not engaged you are free to move anywhere nearby. If you move away from an engaged enemy, you must give up any other action or all enemies you are disengaging from may make a free melee attack.</p>
<h2>Range</h2>
<p><strong>Engaged</strong>: Directly in contact with.</p>
<p><strong>Nearby</strong>: Close, but not engaged.</p>
<p><strong>Far</strong>: Requires a full round to reach.</p>
<h2>Initiative</h2>
<p>At the beginning of combat the PCs and GM roll for initiative.</p>
<p>PCs: 1d20+Dex</p>
<p>GM: 1d20+2</p>
<p>The PCs and GM take their turns in descending order. When everyone has gone, start from the top of the order.</p>
<h2>Combat Rolls</h2>
<p>Melee attack roll (engaged enemies): 1d20+Str+Level ≥ target’s PD</p>
<p>Ranged attack roll (nearby/far targets): 1d20+Dex+Level ≥ target’s PD</p>
<p>Mental attack roll (range varies): 1d20+Cha+Level ≥ target’s MD</p>
<h2>Damage</h2>
<p>Damage is based on class, combat specialty, and special ability used.</p>
<p>Subtract damage from the target’s HP.</p>
<p>A roll of a natural 20 does &times;2 damage.</p>
<p>A modified roll of exactly the targeted enemy’s defense does ½ damage.</p>
<h2>Stunts</h2>
<p>When a PC performs an action such as disarming, knocking down, or pinning an enemy, they declare they are performing a stunt. Make an appropriate attack roll. If successful the target must accept the stunt effect or take damage as if hit by the attack.</p>
<p>If the attack misses, subsequent attempts of the same stunt do ½ damage. A natural 20 on a stunt roll is always successful and the enemy cannot deny the effect.</p>
<h2>Healing</h2>
<p>PCs may be healed by Biomorphics or the Medic special ability. PCs also heal HP equal to their (Con+1)&times;Lvl per day.</p>
<h2>Death &amp; Death Saves</h2>
<p>An enemy reduced to 0 HP is dead or knocked out if the attacker wishes.</p>
<p>A PC reduced to 0 HP is unconscious and can take no actions except making death saves.</p>
<p>Death Save roll:</p>
<p>1d20+Con ≥ Difficulty 15</p>
<p>A PC dies after three failed saves.</p>
<p>A PC stabilizes at 0 HP after three successful saves and does not make further rolls.</p>
<h1>Advancement</h1>
<p>PCs advance in level as they complete adventures or achieve goals set by themselves or the GM. When you level up, calculate your new HP, PD, MD, combat rolls, &amp; attack damage.</p>
<p>Level 10 maximum.</p>
<h2>Special Abilities</h2>
<p>Fighters and Professionals choose a new Special Ability at 4<span class="sps">th</span> &amp; 8<span class="sps">th</span> levels.</p>
<p>Each ability may only be taken once.</p>
<p>Psionics choose a new Psionic Power at 2<span class="sps">nd</span>, 4<span class="sps">th</span> 6<span class="sps">th</span>, 8<span class="sps">th</span> &amp; 10<span class="sps">th</span> levels.</p>
<h2>Attribute Bonuses</h2>
<p>At 5<span class="sps">th</span> &amp; 9<span class="sps">th</span> Lvl, +1 to any attribute.</p>
<h1>Spaceships</h1>
<p>Every party starts with a sloop-class ship suitable for piracy, smuggling, exploration or all of the above. This ship levels up along with the party.</p>

<h2>Electronic Defense (ED)</h2>
<p>The ship’s ability to defend against electronic warfare.</p>
<h1>Space Combat</h1>
<p>Space combat is slightly different from regular combat.</p>
<h2>Initiative</h2>
<p>The Pilot rolls for the sloop. The PCs can take their actions in any order. The gunner should go last.</p>
<h2>Space Combat Rolls</h2>
<p>Weapons attack roll: 1d20+Dex+Level ≥ bogey’s Defense</p>
<p>EM attack roll: 1d20+Int+Level ≥ bogey’s Defense</p>
<p>Crew Station skill roll: 1d20+applicable background+attribute+level ≥ bogey’s Skill.</p>
<h2>Crew Stations &amp; Actions</h2>
<p>The ship’s crew works together in space combat. Each PC mans one or more stations they have an appropriate background for. The PC selects one of the below actions for their station and makes the Crew Station skill or attack roll.</p>
<p>A PC can be assigned to more than one station but still only takes one action. Two PCs assigned the same station agree on an action and use the highest roll.</p>
<h3>Pilot</h3>
<p>Immelmann: Skill roll. +2 to gunner’s next weapons attack.</p>
<p>Guns-D: Skill roll. +2 to PD for one round.</p>
<p>Split-S: Skill roll. Difficulty is bogey’s Skill+5. Ends engagement.</p>
<h3>Engineer</h3>
<p>More Power: Skill roll. +2 damage to next weapons attack.</p>
<p>Repair: Skill roll. Restore Int&times;½Lvl HP.</p>
<p>Flank Speed: Skill roll+2 to pilot’s next roll.</p>
<h3>EW/ECM Officer</h3>
<p>Hack: EM attack. Hit: disable 1 fitting of the enemy ship for 1 round.</p>
<p>EM Attack: Hit: target is -2 to PD for one round.</p>
<p>EM Defense: Skill roll. +2 to ED for 1 round.</p>
<h3>Gunner</h3>
<p>Weapons Attack: Hit: HP damage.</p>
<h2>Repairs</h2>
<p>Damage not fixed by the end of a space battle is serious and can only be repaired in port. While in port an Engineer can fix Int&times;½Lvl HP per day.</p>
<h2>Sucking Vacuum</h2>
<p>A bogey reduced to 0 HP is destroyed.</p>
<p>A PC ship reduced to 0 HP is unable to take actions and is at the mercy of its attacker to be boarded or destroyed.</p>
<h1>Antagonists</h1>
<p>If you’re going to fly around space, you need someone to shoot with a blaster.</p>
<p>Below are the base stats for antagonists level 1 to 10. Most of the time, “&gt;Def” will be PD unless the antagonist is psionic, in which case it will be MD.</p>
<table>

<p>These values are baselines and can be easily tweaked by +1 or -1 to Attack &amp; PD or MD as seems appropriate.</p>
<p>Other examples of variations:</p>
<p>Glass Cannon: +3 attack, 70% HP.</p>
<p>Offensive: +3 attack, -3 defenses.</p>
<p>Defensive: +3 defenses, 70% HP.</p>
<p>Large or veteran: &times;1.5 Dm, &times;2 HP.</p>
<p>Huge or elite: &times;2 Dm, &times;3 HP.</p>

<p>Flight: Disengage from combat freely.</p>
<p>Headshot: Natural 20 kills this enemy.</p>
<p>Mook: 50% Dm. 1 HP only.</p>

<h1>FAQ &amp; Design Notes</h1>
<p><em>A 0 in Str or Dex means I don’t do any damage?</em></p>
<p>Yes. If you want to do damage, take at least a 1 in Str or Dex. In certain circumstances it might be appropriate for anyone to do 1 Dm in melee (such as smashing small mooks).</p>
<p><em>Why is there no equipment?</em></p>
<p>All equipment is built into your stats. PCs are assumed to have whatever equipment and weapons they need for their attacks and backgrounds. Define those however you want.</p>
<p><em>Why is there no money?</em></p>
<p>Any money earned is assumed to go into supplies, fuel, and improving your equipment, ship and lifestyle.</p>
<p><em>Our party’s ship sucks!</em></p>
<p>Look at your backgrounds. This is a game about flying around in a spaceship, you should take some spacey backgrounds.</p>
<p><em>These players are too tough!</em></p>
<p>No such thing. Start throwing higher level or veteran/elite antagonists and frigates at them. If you need opponents above level 10, add levels according to the same progression.</p>
