<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>. Character Creation
</H1> 
<P>
This chapter contains all the information you'll need to create human
characters, including character traits and trait levels, and some
different ways to allocate them.

<P>
For non-human characters-- or characters with supernormal abilities
(magic, psionics, super powers, etc.)-- you will also need to read
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node7.html#chap:supernormal">2</A>, Supernormal Powers, before your
characters will be complete.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Character Creation Terms
</H1> 
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Trait:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>anything that describes a character. A trait can be an
attribute, skill, inherited gift, fault, supernormal power, or any other
feature that describes a character. The GM is the ultimate authority on
what is an attribute and what is a skill, gift, etc.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Level:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>most traits are described by one of seven
adjectives. These seven descriptive words represent levels a trait may
be at. In addition, the Objective Character Creation method grants the
player free levels, and demands he keep track of them. In this case, one
level is required to raise a trait to the next better adjective.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Attribute:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>any trait that everyone in the game world has, in some
degree or other. See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:attributes">1.31</A>, Attributes, for a
sample list of attributes. On a scale of Terrible...Fair...
Superb, the average human will have an attribute at Fair.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Skill:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>any trait that isn't an attribute, but can be improved
through practice. The default for an unlisted skill is usually Poor,
though that can vary up or down a little.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Gift:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>any trait that isn't an attribute or skill, but is
something positive for the character. Some GMs will define a certain
trait as a gift, while others will define the same trait as an
attribute. In general, if the trait doesn't easily fit the
Terrible...Fair...Superb scale, it's probably a gift.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Fault:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>any trait that limits a character's actions, or earns him a bad
reaction from other people.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Supernormal Power:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>although technically gifts, supernormal powers are
treated separately in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node7.html#chap:supernormal">2</A>.

Fudge uses ordinary words to describe various traits of a character. The
following terms of a seven-level sequence are suggested (from best to
worst):

<P>

 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$\bullet$"></SPAN>
<DD>Terrible
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
These levels should be written on each character sheet for easy
reference.

<P>
A GM may alter this list in any way she desires, including expanding or
shrinking it. For example, if Superb doesn't sound right to you, use
Awesome-- or even Way Cool. If the words Mediocre and Fair don't make
sense to you, change them. These seven terms will be used in the rules,
however, for clarity.

<P>
To remember the order, compare adjacent words. If, as a beginner, your
eventual goal is to become an excellent game player, for example, ask
yourself if you'd rather be called a Fair game player or a Mediocre game
player.

<P>
There is an additional level that can be used in Fudge, but is not
listed above: Legendary, which is beyond Superb. Those with Legendary
Strength, for example, are in the 99.9th percentile, and their names can
be found in any book of world records.

<P>
Important Note: not every GM will allow PCs to become Legendary. Even in
games that do include the Legendary level, it is not recommended that
any character be allowed to start the game as Legendary. Superb
represents the 98th to 99.9th percentile of any given trait, which
should be enough for any beginning PC. Of course, if a player character
gets a bit overconfident, meeting an NPC Legendary swordswoman can be a
grounding experience?

<P>
If someone really has to begin play as a Legendary swordsman, strong
man, etc., doing the GM's laundry for half a year or so (in advance)
should be a sufficient bribe to be allowed to start at that level. Of
course, working towards Legendary makes a great campaign goal, and so
PCs may rise to that height, given enough playing time and a generous
GM.

<P>

<A NAME="sec:charactertraits"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Character Traits
</H1> 
<P>
Traits are divided into Attributes, Skills, Gifts, Faults, and
Supernormal Powers. Not every GM will have all five types of traits in
her game. These traits are defined under
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:charcreateterms">1.1</A>, Character Creation Terms, above.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00631000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:attributes"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Attributes
</H2> 
<P>
Gamers often disagree on how many attributes a game should have. Some
prefer few attributes, others many. Even those that agree on the number
of attributes may disagree on the selection. While Fudge discusses some
attributes (Strength, Fatigue, Constitution, etc.) in later sections,
none of these are mandatory. The only attribute the basic Fudge rules
assume is Damage Capacity, and even that is optional-- see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node9.html#sec:damagecapacity">4.52</A>, Damage Capacity.

<P>
Here is a partial list of attributes in use by other games; select to
your taste, or skip these altogether:

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Body:</SPAN> Agility, Aim, Appearance, Balance, Brawn, Build, Constitution,
Coordination, Deftness, Dexterity, Endurance, Fatigue, Fitness, Health,
Hit Points, Manual Dexterity, Muscle, Nimbleness, Quickness, Physical,
Reflexes, Size, Smell, Speed, Stamina, Strength, Wound Resistance, Zip,
and so on.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Mind:</SPAN> Cunning, Education, Intelligence, Knowledge, Learning,
Mechanical, Memory, Mental, Mental Strength, Perception, Reasoning,
Smarts, Technical, Wit, and so on.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Soul:</SPAN> Channeling, Charisma, Charm, Chutzpah, Common Sense,
Coolness, Disposition, Drive, Ego, Empathy, Fate, Honor, Intuition,
Luck, Magic Resistance, Magic Potential, Magical Ability, Power,
Presence, Psyche, Sanity, Self Discipline, Social, Spiritual, Style,
Will, Wisdom, and so on, and so on.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Other:</SPAN> Rank, Status, Wealth.

<P>
Most games combine many of these attributes, while others treat some of
them as gifts or even skills. In Fudge, if you wish, you can even split
these attributes into smaller ones: Lifting Strength, Carrying Strength,
Damage-dealing Strength, etc.

<P>
At this point, the GM decides how many attributes she deems necessary--
or she might leave it up to each player. (Commercial games range from
one or two to over 20.) See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#sec:charexamples">6.3</A>, Character
Examples, for some possibilities.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00632000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:skills"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Skills
</H2> 
<P>
Skills are not related to attributes or their levels in Fudge. Players
are encouraged to design their characters logically-- a character with a
lot of Good physical skills should probably have better than average
physical attributes, for example. On the other hand, Fudge allows a
player to create someone like Groo the Wanderer*, who is very clumsy yet
extremely skilled with his swords.

<P>
(*GROO is a trademark of Sergio Aragonés. If you don't know Groo, go to
a comic book store and check him out!)

<P>
The GM should then decide what level of skill depth she wants. Are
skills broad categories such as ``Social skills,'' or moderately broad
abilities, such as ``Inspire People, Parley, and Market Savvy,'' or are
they specific abilities such as ``Barter, Seduce, Repartee, Persuade,
Fast-Talk, Bully, Grovel, Carouse, Flatter, Bribe,'' etc.?

</DIV>

<P>
An attribute is, in some ways, a very broad skill group, and skills may
be ignored altogether if desired.

<P>
Combat skills require special consideration. The broadest possible
category is simply that: Combat Skills. A broad range breaks that down
to Melee Weapons, Unarmed Combat, and Missile Weapons. A somewhat
narrower approach would break down Melee Weapons into Close Combat Melee
Weapons (knives, blackjacks, etc.), One-handed Melee Weapons (one-handed
swords, axes, maces, etc.) and Two-handed Melee Weapons (polearms,
spears, battle-axes, two-handed swords, etc.). Or, for a precise list of
skills, each group in parentheses could be listed as a separate skill; a
character skilled at using a broadsword knows nothing about using a
saber, for example.

<P>
Each choice has its merits. Broad skill groups that include many
sub-skills make for an easy character sheet and fairly competent
characters, while specific skills allow fine-tuning a character to a
precise degree.

<P>
See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#sec:charexamples">6.3</A>, Character Examples, for an idea of how
broadly or finely skills can be defined in a game.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00633000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:gifts"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Gifts
</H2> 
<P>
A gift is a positive trait that doesn't seem to fit the Terrible...
Fair...Superb scale that attributes and skills fall into. However,
this will vary from GM to GM: a photographic memory is a gift to one GM,
while it is a Superb Memory attribute to another. Some GMs will define
Charisma as an attribute, while others define it as a gift. To one
Gamemaster, a character either has Night Vision or he doesn't; another
will allow characters to take different levels of it. A Gamemaster may
not even have gifts in her game at all.

<P>
Alternatively, gifts can come in levels, but the levels don't
necessarily coincide with the levels used by other traits. For example,
Status might be three- or four-tiered, or even nine-tiered instead of
fitting into the seven levels of attributes and skills. Wealth might
come only in five different levels-- whatever each GM desires.

<P>
Supernormal powers, such as the ability to cast magic spells, fly, read
minds, etc., are technically powerful gifts, but are handled separately
in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node7.html#chap:supernormal">2</A>. Likewise, traits above the human
norm, such as a super strong fantasy or alien race, are treated by
definition as supernormal powers.

<P>
In general, if a gift isn't written on the character sheet, the
character doesn't have it.

<P>
Some possible gifts include:

<P>
Absolute Direction; Always keeps his cool; Ambidextrous; Animal Empathy;
Attractive; Beautiful speaking voice; Bonus to one aspect of an
attribute; Combat Reflexes; Contacts in police force; Danger Sense;
Extraordinary Speed; Healthy Constitution; Keen senses; Literate; Lucky;
Many people owe him favors; Never disoriented in zero Gravity; Never
forgets a name/face/whatever; Night Vision; Patron; Perfect Timing;
Peripheral Vision; Quick Reflexes; Rank; Rapid Healing; Reputation as
Hero; Scale; Sense of empathy; Single-minded (+1 to any lengthy task);
Status; Strong Will; Tolerant; Tough Hide (-1 to damage) Wealth; etc.

<P>
See also Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#sec:charexamples">6.3</A>, Character Examples, for
examples of different gifts. Many others are possible.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00634000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:faults"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Faults
</H2> 
<P>
Faults are anything that makes life more difficult for a character. The
primary faults are those that restrict a character's actions or earn him
a bad reaction from chance-met NPCs. Various attitudes, neuroses and
phobias are faults; so are physical disabilities and social
stigmas. There are heroic faults, too: a code of honor and inability to
tell a lie restrict your actions significantly, but are not signs of
flawed personality.

<P>
Some sample faults: Absent-Minded; Addiction; Ambitious; Amorous
heartbreaker; Bloodlust; Blunt and tactless; Bravery indistinguishable
from foolhardiness; Can't resist having the last word; Code of Ethics
limits actions; Code of Honor; Compulsive Behavior; Coward; Curious;
Finicky; Easily Distractible; Enemy; Fanatic patriot; Full of bluff and
bluster and machismo; Garrulous; Getting old; Glutton; Goes Berserk if
Wounded; Gossip; Greedy; Gullible; Humanitarian (helps the needy for no
pay); Idealist (not grounded in reality); Indecisive; Intolerant;
Jealous of Anyone Getting More Attention; Lazy; Loyal to Companions;
Manic-Depressive; Melancholy; Multiple Personality; Must obey senior
officers; Nosy; Obsession; Outlaw; Overconfident; Owes favors; Phobias;
Poor; Practical Joker; Quick-Tempered; Quixotic; Self-defense Pacifist;
Socially awkward; Soft-hearted; Stubborn; Quick to take offense;
Unlucky; Vain; Violent when enraged; Vow; Worry Wart; Zealous behavior;
etc.

<P>
See also Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#sec:charexamples">6.3</A>, Character Examples, for
examples of different faults. Many others are possible.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00635000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:personality"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Personality
</H2> 
<P>
A character's personality may be represented by one or more traits, or
it can be written out as character background or description.

<P>
As an example of the first case, courage is an attribute, a gift, or
even a fault. As an attribute, Superb Courage or Terrible Courage has an
obvious meaning. As a gift, obvious bravery gives the character a
positive reaction from people he meets (assuming they see him being
courageous, or have heard of his deeds, of course).

<P>
However, both Very Courageous and Very Cowardly can be faults because
they can limit a character's actions. A courageous character might not
run away from a fight even if it were in his best interest, while a
cowardly one would have a hard time staying in a fight even if he stood
to gain by staying.

<P>
Or a character's level of courage might not be a quantified trait at
all, but something the player simply decides. ``Moose is very brave,'' a
player jots down, and that is that. It doesn't have to count as a high
attribute, gift, or fault.

<P>
A player should ask the GM how she wants to handle specific personality
traits. If the player describes his character in detail, the GM can
easily decide which personality traits are attributes, gifts, or
faults. However they are handled, most characters benefit by having
their personalities fleshed out.

<P>

<A NAME="sec:fudgepoints"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN> Fudge Points
</H2> 
<P>
Fudge Points are meta-game gifts that may be used to buy ``luck'' during a
game-- they let the players fudge a game result. These are ``meta-game''
gifts because they operate at the player-GM level, not
character-character level. Not every GM will allow Fudge Points-- those
who prefer realistic games should probably not use them.

<P>
The GM sets the starting number of Fudge Points. The recommended range
is from one to five. Unused Fudge Points are saved up for the next
gaming session. Each player may get an additional number each gaming
session. (This is also set by the GM, and may or may not equal the
starting level.) Alternately, the GM may simply allow Experience Points
(EP) to be traded for Fudge Points at a rate appropriate for the
campaign: 3 EP = 1 Fudge Point, down to 1 EP = 1 Fudge Point.

<P>
Fudge Points can be used in many ways, depending on what level on the
realistic-legendary scale the game is played at. Here are some suggested
ways to use them-- the GM can create her own uses, of course. A GM may
allow as few or many of these options as she wishes-- the players should
ask her before assuming they can do something with Fudge Points.

<LI>Spending a Fudge Point may accomplish an Unopposed action
   automatically and with panache-- good for impressing members of the
   appropriate sex, and possibly avoiding injury in the case of
   dangerous actions. The GM may veto this use of Fudge Points for
   actions with a Difficulty Level of Beyond Superb. The GM may disallow
   this option for an Opposed action, such as combat.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A player may spend one Fudge Point to alter a die roll one level, up
   or down as desired. The die roll can be either one the player makes,
   or one the GM makes that directly concerns the player's character.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A player may spend one Fudge Point to declare that wounds aren't as
   bad as they first looked. This reduces the intensity of each wound by
   one or two levels (a Hurt result becomes a Scratch, for example, or
   even a Very Hurt becomes a Scratch). Or it can mean that any one
   wound (or more), regardless of level, is just a Scratch. This latter
   option may cost more than one Fudge point. The GM can restrict this
   to outside of combat time.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A player may spend one (or more) Fudge Points to get an automatic +4
   result, without having to roll the dice. This use is available in
   Opposed actions, if allowed.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>For appropriately legendary games, a GM-set number of Fudge Points
   can be spent to ensure a favorable coincidence. (This is always
   subject to GM veto, of course.) For example, if the PCs are in a
   maximum security prison, perhaps one of the guards turns out to be
   the cousin of one of the PCs-- and lets them escape! Or the captain
   of the fishing boat rescuing the PCs turns out to be someone who owes
   a favor to one of them, and is willing to take them out of his way to
   help them out? And so on. This option should cost a lot of Fudge
   Points, except in certain genres where bizarre coincidences are the
   norm.

</H1> 
<P>
Character creation in Fudge assumes the players will design their
characters, rather than leaving attributes and other traits to
chance. The GM may allow randomly determined traits if she desires-- a
suggested method is given in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:random">1.8</A>, Random Character
Creation.

<P>
There are no mandatory traits in Fudge. The GM should inform the players
which traits she expects to be most important, and the players may
suggest others to the GM for her approval. The GM may even make a
template, if desired-- a collection of traits she deems important (with
room for customization)-- and let the players define the level of each
trait. See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#sec:templates">6.12</A>, Templates.

<P>
When a character is created, the player should define as many character
traits as he finds necessary-- which may or may not coincide with a
GM-determined list. If a player adds an attribute the GM deems
unnecessary, the GM may treat that attribute as simply a description of
the character. She may require a roll against a different attribute than
the player has in mind, and the player must abide by her decision.

<P>
As an example, a certain GM decides she wants characters to have a
general Dexterity attribute. A player takes Good Dexterity for his PC,
but wants to show that the character is better at whole body dexterity
than at manual dexterity. So he writes: Great Agility and Fair Manual
Dexterity. However, the GM can ignore these distinctions, and simply
require a Dexterity roll, since that is the trait she has chosen. (She
can average the PC-chosen levels, or simply select one of them.) Of
course, she can also allow him to roll on the attributes he has created.

<P>
In Fudge, a character with a trait at Fair will succeed at ordinary
tasks 62% of the time-- there is usually no need to create a
superstar. In fact, Great is just that: great! Superb should be reserved
for the occasional trait in which your character is the best he's ever
met.

<P>
Any trait that is not defined at character creation will be at a default
level:

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">For attributes:</SPAN> Fair.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">For most skills:</SPAN> Poor (easier skills are at Mediocre, while
harder ones are at Terrible). A skill default means untrained, or close
to it. However, it is possible to take a skill at Terrible (below the
default level for most skills), which implies an ineptitude worse than
untrained.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">For most gifts, supernormal powers and certain GM-defined
skills:</SPAN> Non-Existent. (That is, the default is non-existent. The trait
itself exists in some character, somewhere.)

<P>
Each player should expect the GM to modify his character after
creation-- it's the nature of the game. The GM should expect to review
each character before play. It would, in fact, be best if the characters
were made in the presence of the GM so she can answer questions during
the process.

<P>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Subjective Character Creation
</H1> 
<P>
An easy way to create a character in Fudge is simply to write down
everything about the character that you feel is important. Any attribute
or skill should be rated using one of the levels Terrible through Superb
(see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:traitlevels">1.2</A>, Fudge Trait Levels).

<P>
It may be easiest, though, if the GM supplies a template of attributes
she'll be using. See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#sec:charexamples">6.3</A>, Character Examples,
for template ideas.

<P>
The GM may also tell the player in advance that his character can be
Superb in a certain number of attributes, Great in so many others, and
Good in yet another group. For example, in an epic-style game with eight
attributes, the GM allows one Superb attribute, two Greats, and three
Goods. In a more realistic game, this is one Superb, one Great, and two
Goods.

<P>
This can apply to skills, too: one Superb skill, two Great skills, and
six Good skills is a respectable number for a realistic campaign, while
two Superbs, three Greats, and ten Goods is quite generous, even in a
highly cinematic game.

<P>
The GM may also simply limit the number of skills a character can take
at character creation: 10, 15, or 20 are possible choices.

<P>
Gifts and faults can be restricted this way, also. For example, a GM
allows a character to have two gifts, but he must take at least three
faults. Taking another fault allows another gift, or another skill at
Great, and so on.

<P>
These limitations help the player define the focus of the character a
bit better: what is his best trait (what can he do best)?

<P>
A simple ``two lower for one higher'' trait-conversion mechanic can also
be used. If the GM allows one Superb attribute, for example, the player
may forego that and take two attributes at Great, instead. The converse
may also be allowed: a player may swap two skills at Good to get one at
Great.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Example: a player wants a Jack-of-all-trades character, and
the GM has limits of one Superb skill, two Great skills and six Good
skills. The player trades the one Superb skill limit for two Great
skills: he can now take four skills at Great. However, he trades all
four Great skills in order to have eight more Good skills. His character
can now have 14 skills at Good, but none at any higher levels.

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In the Subjective Character Creation system, it is easy to use both
broad and narrow skill groups, as appropriate for the character. In
these cases, a broad skill group is assumed to contain the phrase,
``except as listed otherwise.''

<P>
For example, a player wishes to play the science officer of a
starship. He decides this character has spent so much time studying the
sciences, that he's weak in most physical skills. So on his character
sheet he could simply write:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Physical Skills: Poor

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
He also decides that his character's profession would take him out of
the ship in vacuum quite a bit, to examine things. So he'd have to be
somewhat skilled at zero-G maneuvering. So he then adds:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Zero-G Maneuvering: Good

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Even though this is a physical skill, it is not at Poor because he
specifically listed it as an exception to the broad category.

<P>
When the character write-up is done, the player and GM meet and discuss
the character. If the GM feels the character is too potent for the
campaign she has in mind, she may ask the player to reduce the
character's power-- see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:minimizingabuse">1.9</A>, Minimizing
Abuse.

<P>
The GM may also need to suggest areas that she sees as being too weak--
perhaps she has a game situation in mind that will test a trait the
player didn't think of. Gentle hints, such as ``Does he have any social
skills?'' can help the player through the weak spots. Of course, if there
are multiple players, other PCs can compensate for an individual PC's
weaknesses. In this case, the question to the whole group is then, ``Does
anyone have any social skills?''

<P>
Instead of the player writing up the character in terms of traits and
levels, he can simply write out a prose description of his
character. This requires the GM to translate everything into traits and
appropriate levels, but that's not hard to do if the description is well
written. This method actually produces some of the best characters.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>An example:
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>GM: ``I see you rate Captain Wallop's blaster skill highly, and also his
piloting and gunnery, but I'm only allowing one Superb skill-- which is
he best at?''
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Player: ``Blaster!''
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>GM: ``Okay, Superb Blaster. That would then be Great Piloting and Great
Gunnery, all right? That leaves you with two more skills to be at Great,
since I allow four to start out. Hmmm-- I notice he successfully
penetrated the main Khothi hive and rescued the kidnapped ambassador--
that sounds like a Great Ability to Move Quietly to me-- is that
accurate, or would you describe it as some other ability?''

</H1> 
<P>
For those who don't mind counting numbers a bit, the following method
creates interesting and well-balanced characters.

<P>
In this system, all traits start at default level. The GM then allows a
number of free levels the players may use to raise selected traits to
higher levels. Players may then lower certain traits in order to raise
others even further. Finally, a player may opt to trade some levels of
one trait type (such as attributes) for another (skills, for
example). The whole process insures that no single character will
dominate every aspect of play.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00661000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:objectiveattributes"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Attributes
</H2> 
<P>
A GM using the Objective Character Creation system should decide how
many attributes she deems necessary in the campaign. She can choose to
leave it up to each player, if she wishes. Players then have a number of
free attribute levels equal to half the number of attributes (round
up). For example, if she selects four attributes, each player starts
with two free levels he can use to raise his character's attributes.

<P>
For a more high-powered game, the GM may allow a number of free levels
equal to the number of attributes chosen.

<P>
All attributes are considered to be Fair until the player raises or
lowers them. The cost of raising or lowering an attribute is:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">+3</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Superb</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">+2</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Great</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">+1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Good</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">0</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Fair</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">-1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Mediocre</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">-2</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Poor</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">-3</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Terrible</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
Thus, a player may raise his Strength attribute (which is Fair by
default) to Good by spending one free attribute level. He could then
spend another free level to raise Strength again to Great. This would
exhaust his free levels if there were only four attributes-- but he
would have one more if there were six attributes, and eight more free
levels if there were 20 attributes.

<P>
When the free attribute levels have been exhausted, an attribute can be
raised further by lowering another attribute an equal amount. (See also
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:tradingtraits">1.64</A>, Trading Traits.) From the previous
example, Strength can be raised one more level (to Superb) if the player
lowers the character's Charm to Mediocre to compensate for the increase
in Strength.

<P>
If the GM allows the players to choose their own attributes, she may
simply tell them to take half as many free levels as attributes they
choose. If a player chooses an attribute and leaves it at Fair, that
attribute does not count towards the total of attributes which
determines the amount of free levels. That is, a player cannot simply
add twelve attributes, all at Fair, in order to get six more free levels
to raise the others with. GM-mandated attributes left at Fair do count
when determining the number of free levels, though.

<P>
As an interesting possibility for those who want attributes and skills
to reflect each other accurately, do not let the players adjust
attribute levels at all. Instead, they select only skill levels, gifts
and faults for their characters. When the character is done, the GM can
then determine what attribute levels make sense for the skill levels
chosen, and discuss it with the player.

<P>
Example: a character is made with many combat and wilderness skills, but
no social skills. He also has a smattering of intelligence skills. The
GM decides that this character has Strength, Dexterity and Health of
Great from spending a lot of time outdoors, practicing with weapons,
etc. She will even let the player choose one to be at Superb, if
desired. Perception is probably Good, since wilderness survival depends
on it. Any social attribute is Mediocre at best-- possibly even Poor--
while Intelligence is Mediocre or Fair. If the player objects to the low
Intelligence ranking, the GM can point out that the character hasn't
spent much time in skills that hone Intelligence, and if he wants his
character's IQ to be higher, he should adjust his skill list.

<P>

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Skills
</H2> 
<P>
In the Objective Character Creation system, each player has a number of
free skill levels with which to raise his skills. Suggested limits are:

<P>
For Extremely Broad Skill Groups: 15 levels.

<P>
For Moderately Broad Skill Groups: 30 levels.

<P>
For Specific Skills: 40 to 60 levels.

<P>
Ask the GM for the allotted amount, which will give you a clue as to how
precisely to define your skills. Of course, the GM may choose any number
that suits her, such as 23, 42, or 74...see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#sec:charexamples">6.3</A>, Character Examples. Gamemasters may
devise their own skill lists to choose from-- some possibilities are
included in the skill lists on page&nbsp;<A HREF="node14.html#sec:sampleskills"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.

<P>
Most skills have a default value of Poor unless the player raises or
lowers them-- see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:allocatingtraits">1.4</A>, Allocating Traits.

<P>
Certain skills have a default of non-existent. These would include
Languages, Karate, Nuclear Physics, or Knowledge of Aztec Rituals, which
must be studied to be known at all. When a character studies such a
skill (puts a level into it at character creation, or experience points
later in the game), the level he gets it at depends on how hard it is to
learn. Putting one level into learning the Spanish language, for
example, would get it at Mediocre, since it's of average difficulty to
learn. Nuclear Physics, on the other hand, might only be Poor or even
Terrible with only one level put into it. It would take four levels just
to get such a skill at Fair, for example.

<P>
As in the Subjective Character Creation system, the GM may limit the
number of Superb and Great skills each character may have at character
creation. For a highly cinematic or super-powered game, no limit is
necessary. For example, the GM sets a limit of one Superb skill, three
or four Great skills, and eight or so Good skills. These limits can be
exceeded through character development, of course. See
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#sec:charexamples">6.3</A>, Character Examples.

<P>
Once the free levels are used up, a skill must be dropped one level
(from the default Poor to Terrible) to raise another skill one
level. (See also Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:tradingtraits">1.64</A>, Trading Traits.) All
choices are subject to GM veto, of course.

<P>
It is possible to mix different breadths of skill groupings. A GM who
has little interest in combat can simply choose Unarmed Combat, Melee
Weapons and Ranged Weapons as the only three combat skills. But this
does not stop her from using all the individual Social skills (and many
more) listed as examples on page&nbsp;<A HREF="node14.html#sec:sampleskills"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>. If this
option is chosen, the broad groups cost double the levels of the
narrower groups.

<P>
Mixing skill group sizes within the same areas is awkward in the
Objective Character Creation system. For example, it is difficult to
have a generic Thief Skills group and also have individual skills of
lockpicking, pick-pocketing, palming, security-device dismantling,
etc. If she does wish to do this, then the broad skill group in this
case has a maximum limit of Good, and triple cost to raise-- or more, if
the GM so mandates.

<P>
If the GM is using broad groups, a player may raise a specific skill
(such as Poker, for example, instead of general Gambling skill). A
player would give his character a specific skill when the GM is using
broad-based skill groups to fit a character concept. Do not expect the
character to be equally adept with the other skills in the group. This
would be true for Groo* the Wanderer, for instance, who would simply
raise Sword skill, even if the GM is using the broad term Melee Weapons
as a skill group. Groo would have, in fact, a Poor rating with all other
Melee weapons, and this would accurately reflect the character.

<P>
If the GM has gifts in her game, she may allow player characters to
start with one or two free gifts-- more for epic campaigns. Any further
gifts taken must be balanced by taking on a fault, or by trading traits.

A player may gain extra trait levels by taking GM-approved faults at the

<P>
However, the GM may rule that a particular fault is not serious enough
to be worth two attribute levels, but may be worth one attribute level
or three skill levels. On the other hand, severe faults may be worth
more attribute levels.

<P>
Fudge Points cannot be traded without GM permission. (If tradable, each
Fudge Point should be equal to one or two gifts.)

<P>
So a player with three free attribute levels and 30 free skill levels
may trade three of his skill levels to get another free attribute level,
or six skill levels to get another free gift.

<P>
Whether the character is created subjectively or objectively, each
character has some free uncommitted traits (perhaps two or three). At
some point in the game, a player will realize that he forgot something
about the character that should have been mentioned. He may request to
stop the action, and define a previously undefined trait, subject to the
GM's approval. A sympathetic GM will allow this to happen even during
combat time.

<P>
GM-set skill limits (such as one Superb, three Greats) are still in
effect: if the character already has the maximum number of Superb skills
allowed, he can't make an uncommitted trait a Superb skill.

<P>
The player still gets the standard number of free skill levels, or the
GM may allow only half the normal levels.

<P>
The GM can let the players choose their gifts and faults, or she may
wish to make up separate tables of gifts and faults, and have the
players roll once or twice on each. (Conflicting traits should be
rerolled.) For example:

<P>
And so on. The GM should customize and complete to her taste. Of course,
she could set up a 3d6 table instead of a 2d6 table, or even use a 1d6
table listing general gift or fault areas (Social, Physical, Emotional,
Mental, Wealth/Status, etc.) and then roll again on an appropriate
second table. This would allow 36 equally likely choices.

<P>
Obviously, character creation in Fudge can be abused. There are many
ways to avoid this:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>The GM can require that the character take another fault or two to
   balance the power. (``Okay, I'll allow you to have all that? but you
   need a challenge. Take on another weakness: maybe some secret vice,
   or be unable to tell a believable lie, or anything that fits the
   character concept that I can use to test you now and then.'')

<P>
</LI>
<LI>She can simply veto any trait (or raised/lowered combination) she
   feels is abusive. (``I see you raised Battle-Axe in exchange for
   lowering Needlepoint. Hmmm.'') This allows the GM to customize the
   power level of a game. For high-powered games, allow most anything;
   for less cinematic campaigns, make them trade equally useful trait
   for trait.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>She can simply note the character weaknesses and introduce a
   situation into every adventure where at least one of them is
   significant to the mission. (``You'll be sent as an emissary to the
   Wanduzi tribe-- they value fine Needlepoint work above all other
   skills, by the way...'')

<P>
</LI>
<LI>She can use the ``disturbance in the force'' technique of making sure
   that more powerful characters attract more serious problems. (``The
   bruiser enters the bar with a maniacal look in his eye. He scans the
   room for a few seconds, then begins to stare intently at you.'')
</LI>
</OL>
