<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>. Supernormal Powers
</H1>

<P>
If your game doesn't have any supernormal powers, you don't need to read
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="#chap:supernormal">2</A> at all. Genres such as modern espionage,
WWII French resistance, gunslingers of the Old West, or swashbuckling
Musketeers are frequently played without supernormal powers. Feel free
to skip ahead directly to Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node8.html#chap:actionresolution">3</A>, Action
Resolution.

<P>
However, those who play in games with non-human races, magic, psi,
superpowers, etc., will need to read this chapter before character
creation is complete.

</H1>  
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Supernormal power:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>that which is beyond the capability of human
beings as we know them. Supernormal powers are treated as powerful
gifts. Some may have associated skills (which are taken separately,
using the normal skill rules).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Power:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>a supernormal power.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Mana:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>magical energy. Mana is an invisible substance that
magicians can detect (or even create) and manipulate to alter matter,
time and space.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Magic:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>the art of influencing events through manipulation of
mana, or through compelling beings from another dimension, or channeling
power from some other source. Magic may be studied by humans, but it is
inherent in some races, such as natives of Faerie.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Miracle:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>magic performed by a deity. Miracles are often
subtle. Holy persons can attempt to work miracles by invoking their
deity. Some religions call any non- or semi-material being greater than
human a deity. Others believe there is only one Deity, and that these
other beings are simply angels, demons, djinni, efriti, etc. In the
former belief, magical results wrought by these superhuman beings are
miracles; in the latter belief, they are not miracles, but merely a
display of more psychic power than humans are capable of.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Psi:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>any power that involves mind over matter, time or space.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Superpower:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>any supernormal power that is an inherent ability,
whether because of mutation, exposure to radiation, a gift of space
aliens, etc., or granted by a device, such as an alien-science
belt. Examples of superpowers can be found in many comic books, and
include super strength, the ability to fly, see through walls, cling to
ceilings, become invisible, etc.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Cybernetic Enhancement:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>any mechanical or electronic enhancement
to a normal body that gives the character supernormal powers.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Non-human Races:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>certain fantasy and science fiction races
(actually species) have abilities beyond the human norm, such as being
much stronger, or able to fly, etc. Most of these abilities could also
be classified as Psi or Superpowers, so they are not treated separately,
except for Mass and Strength. Androids and robots are considered races
for rules purposes.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Scale:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>characters may have certain attributes that are well
beyond the human norm, one way or the other, but that need to be related
to the human norm. Prime examples include Strength, Mass, and
Speed. Such attributes are rated in Scale. Human Scale is 0. A race (or
individual) of greater than human average strength, for example, would
be Scale 1 Strength or more, while a race of lesser average strength
than humans would be Scale -1 Strength or less. Individuals can then be
of Fair strength, or Good strength, etc., relative to those of their own
Scale.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Genetic Enhancement:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>a genetic enhancement may or may not give a
character supernormal powers. If it does, then it must be treated like
any other supernormal power listed above.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Powers at Character Creation
</H1> 
<P>
Supernormal powers may or may not be available in a given game. They are
not appropriate to all genres.

<P>
The best way to design a supernormal character is through close
discussion with the GM. A player should describe what he wants the
character to be able to do, and the GM will decide if that's within the
limits she has in mind for the game. If not, she'll make suggestions
about how to change the character to fit her campaign.

<P>
Supernormal powers are treated as powerful gifts, with availability set
by the GM. The GM may decide that each player can take two Powers for
free, for example, or five, or more. The player may make a case for
further Powers, but may need to take faults to balance them.

<P>
Some Powers are so effective that they are worth more than other
Powers. In the Objective Character Creation system, the GM may set the
cost of a certain supernormal power equal to two or three ``average''
supernormal powers. In some cases, the GM may veto player suggestions
outright: omniscience and omnipotence are good examples!

<P>
The GM may decide that supernormal powers may be pooled with other
traits for trading purposes. In this case, one average Power is worth
two gifts. For example, a player who wishes to play a magician in a
fantasy setting will need to trade some skill, attribute, or gift levels
to buy magical Powers.

<P>
Undefined Powers have a default of non-existent-- that is, they do not
have a default value of Fair, like attributes, or Poor, like skills. If
a supernormal power is not defined for a character, he doesn't have it.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Powers Available
</H2> 
<P>
The GM needs to design the type, number allowed, and drawbacks of Powers
in her game. Some examples:

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Types of Powers:</SPAN> a given campaign may allow magic, psi,
superpowers, etc., or some combination of the above. The GM also needs
to decide how finely a supernormal power is subdivided. Is ESP a generic
Power, or is it split into separate Powers such as Precognition and
Clairvoyance? Is magic subdivided into spells, or groups of spells (such
as elemental magic) or simply the ability to break the laws of nature in
any way that can be imagined? And so on.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Number of Powers allowed:</SPAN> the GM may set the number of Powers
allowed per character. The number may range from one to 20-- or even
more. Multiple Powers per character are especially likely in a fantasy
campaign where individual spells are separate Powers.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Drawbacks of Powers:</SPAN> in some campaigns, using a Power may bear
a penalty or have some drawback. Typical drawbacks include mental or
physical fatigue, lengthy time requirements, unreliable or
uncontrollable results, and undesirable side effects (such as loud
noises, bad smells, and the like). Some Powers will only work under
certain conditions or with certain materials, or are limited to a
certain number of uses per day-- or month. Others may be risky to the
character, affecting physical or mental health. The GM may allow
drawbacks to count as faults: a number of them can offset the cost of a
Power in the Objective Character Creation system.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Associated Skills
</H2> 
<P>
If a Power logically requires a skill to use it efficiently, the skill
must be bought separately. For example, the superpower Flight allows a
character to fly, and usually no skill roll is needed. But the ability
to make intricate maneuvers in close combat without slamming into a wall
requires a roll against a Flying skill. (The GM may ignore this and
simply say that no roll is needed for any flying maneuver with a Flight
Power.)

<P>
Another common skill is Throwing: hurling balls of fire or bolts of
energy at a foe. Or the GM might rule that being able to aim and
accurately release such energy comes with the power for free: no roll
needed, it automatically hits the target every time unless the target
makes a Good Dodge roll (see Chapter 4, Combat, Wounds &amp; Healing).

<P>
This can be especially true with magic: the ability to cast spells at
all may be a gift, but to do it right is a skill, or even many different
skills.

<P>

<A NAME="sec:combatpowers"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Combat Powers
</H2> 
<P>
If a supernormal power can be used to attack a foe, the GM must
determine the strength of the Power for damage purposes-- preferably
during character creation. An offensive Power is usually handled as a
propelled weapon, such as a gun, or as being equivalent to a certain
melee weapon. This can just be expressed in terms of damage, though,
such as Ball of Fire, +6 damage, or large Claws, +3 damage. (See
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node9.html#sec:samplewoundfactors">4.54</A>, Sample Wound Factors List.)

<P>
In the case of a magical or superhero attack, the more potent the
attack, the greater the power required, or perhaps the greater the
strain on the character who uses it. This can be a penalty to the skill
level, greater fatigue, and/or some other disadvantage.

<P>

<A NAME="sec:nonhumans"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Non-humans
</H1> 
<P>
Some campaigns will have characters (or animals, monsters, etc.) with
traits beyond the human norm. In particular, characters with Strength
and Speed well above or below the human range are common in role-playing
games. Examples include giants, superheroes, pixies, aliens, ogres,
intelligent rabbits, robots, etc.

<P>
In Fudge, Strength, Mass and Speed are rated by the GM in terms of Scale
for different races. Most other traits that may be different for
non-humans are handled with a Racial Bonus or Penalty rather than being
on a different Scale-- see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:racialbonus">2.35</A>. Of course,
the GM may assign any trait she wishes in terms of Scale.

<P>
Humans are of Scale 0, unless some other race is the game-world
norm. (E.g., if all the PCs are playing pixies or giants. In these
cases, the PCs' race is Scale 0, and humans would be a different Scale.)
Non-human races can have a positive or negative number for Scale,
depending on whether they are stronger (or bigger or faster) or weaker
(or smaller or slower) than humans.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00731000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:strengthandmass"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Strength and Mass
</H2> 
<P>
The word Scale used alone always means Strength/ Mass Scale in Fudge--
any other Scale, such as Speed, or Strength without Mass, will be
defined as such.

<P>
Each level of Strength (from Terrible to Superb) is defined to be 1.5
times stronger than the previous level. A character with Good Strength
is thus 1.5 times as strong as a character with Fair Strength. Note that
this progression is not necessarily true for any other attribute. There
is a wider range of strength in humans than dexterity, for example:
Superb Dexterity is only about twice as good as Fair Dexterity.

<P>
Strength Scale increases in the same way: a Scale 1, Fair Strength
individual is 1.5 times stronger than a Scale 0, Fair Strength
individual. This holds for each increase in Scale: a Scale 10 Superb
Strength creature is 1.5 times stronger than a Scale 9 Superb Strength
creature, for example.

<P>
At this point, it is tempting to say that a Scale 1 Fair Strength is
equal to a Scale 0 Good Strength. This is true for Strength, but not for
Mass. Scale really measures Mass, or Density, and Strength just goes
along for the ride.

<P>
In Fudge, Mass has a specific meaning: how wounds affect a
character. (This may or may not coincide with the scientific definition
of Mass.) It takes more human-powered hits to weaken a giant than a
human, for example. She may not really be a healthy giant, but her sheer
bulk means that human-sized sword strokes don't do as much damage
relative to her as they would to a human-- unless they hit a vital spot,
of course. Likewise, a pixie can be healthy and robust, but not survive
a single kick from a human. The difference is Mass, and the strength
related to it.

<P>
A Scale 1 Fair Strength fighter has an advantage over a Scale 0 Good
Strength fighter, even though their Strengths are equal. The Scale 1
fighter is less affected by the other's damage due to his
mass. Therefore, do not blithely equate Scale 0 Good with Scale 1 Fair.

<P>
Of course, the GM may envision a less massive but harder to kill race
than humans. This is best handled by a Racial Bonus
(Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:racialbonus">2.35</A>), either as a Toughness Gift (Tough Hide,
or Density-- either one would subtract from damage), or by a bonus to
Damage Capacity.

<P>
The GM may decide that increased Mass does not necessarily mean of
greater size-- the race may be of denser material. Dwarves in northern
European legend were derived from stone, and are hence denser than
humans. Such a dwarf hits harder and shrugs off damage easier than most
humans: he is Scale 1, though shorter than a human. (Of course, the GM
should define dwarves' attributes and Scale to her own requirements.)

<P>
Normally, Strength and Mass are handled by a single Scale figure. That
is, if a creature is said to be Scale 7, that means Scale 7 Mass and
Scale 7 Strength. Strength can vary within each race just as it can for
humans. You can have Scale 10 Superb Strength Giants and Scale 10
Terrible Strength Giants. Unlike Strength, though, it is not recommended
that Mass vary much within a race. If you do allow Mass to vary for an
individual, it should never be worse than Mediocre or better than
Good. In fact, it is far better to call Good Mass a Gift, and Mediocre
Mass a fault than treat it as an attribute.

<P>
The GM may choose to separate Strength Scale from Mass Scale. This would
allow Pixies of Strength Scale -6 and Mass Scale -4, for
example. However, combat between two Pixies would not work the same as
combat between two humans. In this case, they would have a harder time
hurting each other than humans would, since their Strength Scale
(ability to give out damage) is lower than their Mass Scale (ability to
take damage). This may actually be what she wants: a super-strong
superhero who can dish out punishment but can't take it can be
represented by Strength Scale 10, Mass Scale 2, for example.

<A NAME="sec:scalespeed"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Speed
</H2>  
<P>
Each level of Speed (from Terrible to Superb) is defined to be 1.2 times
faster than the previous level. A character with Good Speed is thus 1.2
times as fast as a character with Fair Speed. This is not the same
progression as for Strength.

<P>
Speed Scale increases in the same manner: a Scale 1, Fair Speed
individual is 1.2 times faster than a Scale 0, Fair Speed
individual. This holds for each increase in Scale: a Scale 10 Superb
Speed animal is 1.2 times faster than a Scale 9 Superb Speed animal, for
example.

<P>
Speed is not a necessary attribute, of course, and can be ignored
entirely if desired. It is included primarily for creatures and vehicles
significantly faster than humans. For comparison purposes, assume a Fair
Speed human can run at about 10 mph (16 kph) over some distance,
provided they are in shape, of course. Sprinting short distance is
somewhat faster. This comes to about 15 yards (meters) per three-second
combat round.

<P>
Note that in short races, you don't really have to roll the dice to see
if someone of Superb Speed can beat someone of Good Speed-- he can, and
will, much more often than rolling the dice would reveal.

<P>
The Speed Scale rises too slowly for comparing such things as race cars
or space ships to human movement. In these cases, either use a rough
human Scale, or simply set the average space ship at Space Ship Speed
Scale 0, and rate others relative to it. Thus, the average race car will
be roughly human Scale 12-- or you can simply call it Race Car Scale 0,
and compare other race cars to it. A Space Ship might be Human Scale
100, or Space Ship Scale 0.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Scale Correlations
</H2> 
<P>
The Gamemaster should refer to the following table when assigning a
Scale to a race. This only has to be done once, at race creation.

<P>
First, the GM should decide how much stronger (or weaker or faster,
etc.) the average member of race X is compared to the average human. For
example, she decides that Ogres are three times stronger than humans,
and pixies are eight times weaker (which equals 0.12 times as
strong). She then needs to look up the closest numbers to these strength
multipliers on the table below, and look in the corresponding Scale
column to find the correct racial Strength/Mass Scales. In this example,
Ogres are Scale 3 creatures, while Pixies are Scale -6. (You may
envision Ogres and Pixies differently, of course.)

<P>
(See Miscellaneous Charts and Tables for a sample Mass Scale Table with
examples.)

<P>
The Strength/Mass Scale number is figured into damage in combat, and all
weapons and armor are assumed to be of the same Scale as the
wielder. (These numbers have been rounded to the nearest useful
number. They are only roughly 1.5 times the previous number, but close
enough for game purposes.)

<P>
Other examples: a GM reads in a Medieval text that a dragon is ``as
strong as 20 warriors.'' Looking at the table, 20 times the human norm is
Scale 8. However, since the average warrior has Good strength, she
chooses Scale 9 for the average dragon in her world. Of course, an
individual dragon can still have Poor Strength compared to other
dragons. This is simply listed as Strength Poor (-2), Scale 9.

<P>
This same GM wants PC leprechauns to be available. While they are small,
she decides their magic makes them a bit stronger than their size would
otherwise indicate: Scale -4. So a Good Strength leprechaun is as strong
as a Terrible Strength human in her world.

<P>
The GM can also use this table to determine relative lifting strength or
carrying capacity of characters or beasts if she wishes.

<P>
The GM may require a Strength roll to lift a given object. This will
depend on the Scale of the character, of course. Thus, a leprechaun
might need a Good Difficulty Level Strength roll to lift a rock that a
human could lift without even a roll. (See
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node8.html#chap:actionresolution">3</A>, Action Resolution.)

<P>

<A NAME="sec:scalecost"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Cost of Scale
</H2> 
<P>
If you are using the Objective Character Creation system, each step of
increased Strength/Mass Scale for a player character should cost one
attribute level and one gift. This is because each level of Scale
includes +1 Strength and extra Mass, which is the equivalent of the
Tough Hide gift. However, a generous GM may charge less.

<P>
In a superhero game, this gets very expensive, very quickly. An
alternative method: let one supernormal power equal a certain Scale. For
example, the GM allows one Power to equal Scale 4 (five times as strong
as the average human). A character buys three Powers of super strength
and has Scale 12 Strength. Another GM allows Scale 13 (200 times as
strong as the average human) to equal one Power. Since a character with
two Powers in super strength would have Scale 26 Strength (!), the GM
decides to limit the amount of super strength available to one Power.

<P>
A player then raises or lowers his character's Strength attribute to
show how he compares to the average super-strong superhero. Strength can
then be raised to Scale 13 Good, for example, at the cost of one
attribute level.

<P>
The GM may also allow separate Mass and Strength for superheroes (or
even races). For example, the superhero mentioned in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:strengthandmass">2.31</A> with Strength Scale 10 and Mass Scale
2 would only have to pay for two gifts and ten attribute levels. Or,
with a generous GM, a single supernormal power covers the entire cost.

<P>
Other supernormal powers may have levels. Examples include Telekinesis
(increased power allows greater weight to be lifted), Telepathy
(increased power equals greater range), Wind Control (increased power
allows such things as a jet of wind, whirlwind, or tornado), etc.

<P>
In these cases, each level can be bought as a separate supernormal
power, which is expensive. Or you could use the option given above for
Scale: one supernormal power buys the supernormal ability at a middling
power range, and a simple attribute (or even skill) level raises or
lowers it from there.

<P>
For Scales below the human norm, each step of Mass Scale includes a
fault equivalent to Easily Wounded, and the GM may allow this to be used
to balance other traits like any other fault-- see Section 1.64, Trading
Traits.

<A NAME="sec:racialbonus"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Racial Bonuses and Penalties
</H2> 
<P>
There is rarely any need to use Scale for traits other than Strength,
Mass and Speed. It's easy to imagine someone wanting to play a race that
is slightly more intelligent than humans, but a race ten times smarter
than the smartest human is so alien that it would be impossible to
play. This is true for most traits-- we just can't grasp such extreme
differences from our world view.

<P>
Actually, there is a way to use intelligence in Scale: in a
non-quantified manner. For example, when creating a dog character, you
can list:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Intelligence: Great (Scale: Dog)

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Since no one is able to quantify inter-species intelligence accurately,
do not expect to use it comparatively. It gives an indication that,
relative to other dogs, this dog has Great intelligence. The word
``Scale'' isn't necessary-- ``Great canine intelligence'' works just as
well.

<P>
The GM should usually use Racial Bonuses or Penalties for traits other
than Strength, Mass and Speed. If the GM envisions halflings as being
particularly hardy, she can give them a +1 bonus to Constitution:
halfling Fair Constitution equals human Good Constitution. As another
example, an alien race, Cludds, have a racial penalty of -1 to
Intelligence.

<P>
It is best to use trait levels relative to humans on the character
sheets, though you should put the racial-relative term in
brackets. (Example: Grahkesh, Intelligence Poor [Cludd Fair].) However,
always list Strength relative to the character's own race, with the
Scale (if other than 0), so the Mass will be accurate. See the sample
character, Brogo the Halfling (Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#sec:brogo">6.311</A>), for an example
of both racial bonus and different Scale.

<P>
Racial bonuses and penalties can be used for any type of trait:
attributes, skills, gifts, supernormal powers, or faults.

<P>
If using the Objective Character Creation system, each level of a Racial
Bonus or Penalty is usually equal to one level of the specific trait
raised or lowered normally. That is, if you are granting a +1 to Agility
or +1 to Perception for a race, it should cost one attribute level. If a
race has a bonus of a Perfect Sense of Direction, it should cost one
gift. The innate ability to fly or cast magic spells should cost one
supernormal power, etc.

<P>
If a race is at -1 to all Social skills, however, this should only be
worth -1 skill level if you have a single skill called Social Skills. If
you have many social individual social skills, it should be worth one
fault. The converse is true for Bonuses that affect many skills: it
should cost one or more gifts.

<P>

<A NAME="sec:legendaryheroes"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Legendary Heroes
</H1>

<P>
Some genres allow human characters to develop beyond the realm of the
humanly possible. Such campaigns eventually involve planes of existence
beyond the mundane as the PCs require greater and greater challenges.

<P>
This style of gaming can be represented in Fudge by Legendary
Levels. Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node6.html#sec:traitlevels">1.2</A>, Levels, introduced the concept of
Legendary traits as a goal for PCs to work toward. This section expands
that concept infinitely.

<P>
If the GM and players prefer this type of gaming, any skill can be
raised beyond Legendary. Instead of renaming each level, simply use a
numbering system: Legendary 2nd Level Swordsman, Legendary 3rd Level
Archer, etc. Attributes can also be raised, but (except for Strength)
this is much rarer.

<P>
Each level of Legendary gives a +1 bonus to any action resolution. The
character Hugh Quickfinger, for example, has a Longbow skill of
Legendary 2nd Level. This gives him a total bonus of +5 (+3 for Superb,
and +2 for two levels of Legendary). In any contest against a Fair
Longbowman (+0), Hugh should easily triumph.

<P>
The Objective Character Development system,
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node10.html#sec:objectivedevel">5.2</A>, lists suggested experience point costs
for attaining these levels.

<P>
These levels do not automatically exist in any given game: these are
strictly optional levels for specific, non-realistic genres.

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Magic
</H1> 
<P>
If the Gamemaster wishes to include magic in the campaign, it may be
easiest to translate whatever magic system she is familiar with into
Fudge. If she wishes to craft her own Fudge magic rules, she should
consider what she wants magic to be like in her game world.

<P>
Questions to ask include: What is the source of magic? Is it a natural
process, such as mana manipulation? If it does use mana, does the mage
create the mana, or is it inherent in a locale? Or does the mage summon
other-world entities to do his bidding? Or must the mage find a source
of Power and channel it to his own ends? Or is the source of magic
something altogether different?

<P>
Can anyone learn to work magic, or is it an inherent talent (that is,
does it require a supernormal power)? Are there levels of Power
available, and what would having more levels mean? Is a skill also
required? Of course, even if a magician must have a Power to cast
spells, there may also be magic items that anyone can use-- these are
common in tales and legends.

<P>
If beings are summoned, are they evil, good, neutral, confused? How do
they feel about being commanded to work for the magician? Can they
adversely affect the magician if he fails a spell roll? If Power is
being channeled from an external source, is that source in the physical
plane or astral? Is it from a living being, or contained in an inanimate
object as inert energy, like a piece of coal before going into a fire?

<P>
What is the process of using magic? Does it involve memorized spells?
Physical components? Meditation? Complex and time-consuming ritual? How
long does it take to cast a spell? Can a spell be read out of a book?
Improvised on the spot?

<P>
How reliable is magic? Are there any drawbacks? Any societal attitudes
toward magicians? Is it common knowledge that magicians exist, or are
they a secret cabal, whose doings are only whispered about in
ever-changing rumors?

<P>
Once these issues have been resolved, and the degree of magic in the
game decided on, the magic system can be created using Fudge
mechanics. A sample magic system, Fudge Magic, is included in
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#chap:addenda">7</A>, The Addenda.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00760000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:miracles"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN> Miracles
</H1> 
<P>
Fudge assumes miracles are powered by a deity. Some miracles may happen
at the deity's instigation (GM whim, or deus ex machina for plot
purposes), and some may be petitioned by characters.

<P>
Miracles may take place in a startling fashion or in a mundane way. In
fact, many people believe that miracles occur daily, but we don't notice
them because they appear as simple coincidences. The stranger walking
down the road who just happens to have the tools you need to fix your
wagon might indeed be just a coincidence, or it may have been divinely
arranged that he chanced by at that time. If the tools were simply to
appear by themselves, or the wagon fix itself, there would be little
doubt that a miracle had occurred. This is neither good nor bad-- the GM
can choose either method of granting miracles, and need not feel bound
to be consistent.

<P>
The GM must decide whether miracles can occur in her world, and whether
they can be called by character petition. If the latter, then she has to
make many other decisions. Can any character petition a particular
deity? Does it matter if the character is actually a member of a
religious order? How important is the character's behavior-- would a
deity help a member of a particular religious order even if he had been
acting against the deity's goals? How certain is the miracle to occur?
How soon will it become manifest? How broad and how specific can
requests be? Are any Ritual or Supplication skills needed to petition a
deity, or can anyone simply breathe a prayer for help?

<P>
The answers will vary from GM to GM-- no ``generic'' system of miracles is
possible. A sample miracle system, Fudge Miracles, is included in
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#chap:addenda">7</A>, The Addenda.

<A NAME="sec:psi"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN> Psi
</H1>

<P>
Again, it is probably easiest for the GM to translate whatever psionics
rules she knows to Fudge. As a simple system, each psionic ability can
be a separate supernormal power. The ability to read minds, or foresee
the future, or telekinetically move an object, etc., each cost one
supernormal power (two gifts). Just how powerful the psionic ability is
depends on the level of psi the GM wants for the game world. Someone who
can telekinetically lift a battleship is obviously more powerful than
someone who can't lift anything heavier than a roulette ball-- though
the latter may make more money with his power, if he's highly skilled!

<P>
If the game world has more than one level of power available, then a
character must spend multiple free power levels to get the higher
levels. See also Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:scalecost">2.34</A>, Cost of Scale.

<P>
In general, higher levels of Psi Powers equal greater range, or the
ability to affect larger or more subjects at once, or access to a
greater number of related skills (a low Telepathy Power lets you send
your thoughts to another, for example, but greater Power lets you read
minds, send painful waves of energy, sense emotions, and possibly even
control others). A higher level might also let you use less fatigue or
have a lower risk of burnout, take less time in concentration to use, or
allow more uses per day, or be used in a broader range of conditions (a
low ESP Power can only be accessed in a darkened room, for example,
while a high Power level can be used at any time), and so on.

<P>
The GM may also require skills to use these powers. Having the psionic
ability to use telekinesis just allows you to pick an object up with
your mental powers, and move it crudely about. Fine manipulation, such
as picking a pocket, requires a successful roll against a telekinetic
skill.

<P>
A sample psi system, Fudge Psi, is included in
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#chap:addenda">7</A>, The Addenda.

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN> Superpowers
</H1> 
<P>
If the campaign allows superpowers similar to those found in comic
books, there will probably be a wide variety of powers available. How
many an individual character can have depends on the power level of the
campaign. A common treatment of superheroes involves faults related to
Powers, which makes more Powers available to the character. For example,
a super hero is able to fly, but only while intangible. The accompanying
fault lowers the cost of the Power to that of a gift.

<P>
There are far too many powers to list in Fudge-- browsing through a
comic store's wares will give you a good idea of what's available. As
with psionics, each power costs one of the free supernormal powers
available, and some can be taken in different levels. Potent ones cost
two or more of the ``average'' superpowers.

<P>
Super strength is treated as a separate scale-- see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:nonhumans">2.3</A>, Non-humans. Other superpowers that come in
levels are discussed in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:scalecost">2.34</A>, Cost of Scale.

<P>
Artificial limbs, organs, implants and neural connections to computers
are common in some science fiction settings. If these grant powers
beyond the human norm, they must be bought with supernormal power levels
if using the Objective Character Creation system, or with the GM's
approval in any case.

<P>
If an implant grants a bonus to an attribute, it should cost as much as
the attribute bonus, which is not necessarily as much as a supernormal
power. Since an artificial implant may occasionally fail, however, the
GM can give a slight cost break by also allowing a free skill level
elsewhere on the character sheet.
