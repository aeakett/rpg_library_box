</H1> 
<P>
Date: November, 1992 to November, 1993

<P>
By: Steffan O'Sullivan

<P>
Here is a sample magic system, based on the following premises mentioned
in Section 2.5, Magic:

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Who can cast:</SPAN> Magicians only (supernormal power needed).

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Levels of Power:</SPAN> yes. There are two game effects: the greater
the power, the easier it is to cast more powerful spells; and power
levels act as a reserve in case of severe failure, which temporarily
drains Power. Voluntarily draining a level of Power can also guarantee
success for one spell.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Source of Power:</SPAN> manipulation of local area mana.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Reliability:</SPAN> Fair.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Time to cast spells:</SPAN> depends on potency of spell (one minute to
days). This can be speeded up by taking a penalty to the roll.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Spells:</SPAN> improvised. Exact wording isn't important, so magic
books tend to be collections of effects, not formulae.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Material Components:</SPAN> none needed, but good use can give a +1
bonus to skill.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Drawbacks:</SPAN> casting non-trivial spells is fatiguing; severe
failure causes distress.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Societal constraints:</SPAN> none-- magic is rare, but not unheard
of.

<P>
This system is based on the conviction that a player using magic should
never be blasé: there should always be some tension and excitement when
a character casts a spell, or the magic has gone out of the game. Too
often in a role-playing game, the player running a magician uses
tried-and-true spells so regularly that spell-casting becomes
mundane. Since ``mundane magic'' seems a contradiction in terms, Fudge
Magic attempts to instill a little excitement into spell-casting.

<P>
There are many ways to achieve this. Fudge Magic has chosen the
following limitations:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>The mana available for a specific spell result gradually becomes
   depleted in a given area. That is, casting two fireballs in a row is
   harder than casting one fireball and one lightning blast, for
   example.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Magic is an untamable force; there is a skill cap for casting spells.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Magic is somewhat risky to use-- there are penalties for severe
   failure.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Options are provided to alter these limitations for GMs who dislike
them. In fact, Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:spellcastingskillalternatives">7.193</A>,
Spell-Casting Skill Alternatives, is essential for Faerie races and
demigods, who have much more dependable magic powers than
humans. (Unless the GM is generous, such characters would have to buy
higher skill levels normally if using the Objective Character Creation
system. Taking some faults to balance such Powers is in keeping with the
nature of demigods and Faerie races.)

<P>
See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#sec:fantasycharacters">6.31</A> for sample characters using
Fudge Magic.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001211000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:magicpotential"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Magic Potential
</H2> 
<P>
Magic Potential is a Supernormal Power. (A suggested cost in the
Objective Character Creation system is two gifts for each level of Magic
Potential. This can be reduced in a magic-rich campaign.) A character
with at least one level of Magic Potential (usually abbreviated to
Potential, sometimes simply called Power) is referred to as a ``magician''
in these rules-- substitute your favorite word. Only magicians may cast
spells. (However, see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:magesandnonmages">7.192</A>, Magicians &amp;
Non-Magicians, for other options.) Magic Potential may be taken more
than once, but each level counts as a separate supernormal power.

<P>
Each level of Magic Potential must be bought as a
specialization. Specializations can be suggested by the player or set by
the GM. (In the latter case, she should make a list of acceptable magic
specializations.) The categories can be as broad or as narrow as the GM
wishes-- the broader the terms, the more powerful the magicians.

<P>
Examples of specialized Potential: Alter Inanimate Material, Augury,
Combat Magic, Communication Magic, Defensive Magic, Elemental Magic,
Flying Magic, Healing Magic, Illusion, Information-Gathering Magic, Mind
Control, Necromancy, Only Affects Living Beings, Only Affects Sentient
Beings, Only Affects Technological Items, Shapeshifting, White Magic
(cannot harm anyone, even indirectly), etc.

<P>
A character may have Power levels in more than one specialization,
unless the GM disallows it for some reason. Certain disciplines may have
societal constraints: in most cultures, studying Necromancy is offensive
and probably illegal. Mind Control, Invisibility, Teleportation,
Illusion Magic, etc., might all be limited to government-approved
magicians, at best. It's even possible that such magicians will be
outlaws. Anything that can be used easily to commit a crime (especially
assassination or thievery) will be difficult, if not impossible, to
learn openly in most cultures. If a given culture allows such magic
openly, it is sure to have powerful defenses against being damaged by
it.

<P>
Narrow specializations should probably cost less than one supernormal
power: perhaps each specialized Potential is worth one gift.

<P>
In order to cast a spell of a given result, the magician must have at
least +1 Potential specialized in that type of magic (on the character
sheet, that is: he may be temporarily reduced to 0 Potential). Someone
with +1 Potential: Combat Magic and +2 Potential: Information-Gathering
Magic could not cast a spell to create food in the wilderness, for
example.

<P>
Failing a spell miserably causes the temporary loss of a level of Magic
Potential (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:magicresolution">7.15</A>, Resolution). When this
happens, the magician faints for at least one combat round. He needs a
Good Constitution roll to wake up (roll each round). When he comes to,
the magician may function normally, even attempting to cast the same
spell again-- if he hasn't dropped below 0 Potential.

<P>
If a magician has two or more types of Potential that are appropriate
for the spell being cast, and a loss of Potential is called for, the GM
decides which type of Potential is reduced. For example, a magician has
one level of Combat Magic and two levels of Fire Magic, and fails
miserably on a fireball spell. The GM could say that he has lost either
his one level of Combat Magic or one of his Fire Magic levels, but not
one of each.

<P>
If a magician drops to -1 Potential in any given specialty, he
immediately falls into a coma, lasting anywhere from an hour to a day
(GM's decision). When he wakes, he must roll against his Constitution:
on a Mediocre or worse roll, he takes a point of damage. He checks
Constitution again at the end of every day he is active-- a failed
result means another point of damage. These wounds cannot be healed
until he recharges his Magic Potential back up to level 0.

<P>
A magician with 0 Potential may still cast spells; a magician at -1
Magic Potential, however, cannot attempt any magic spells that would
involve that specialty. He may still cast spells of another
specialty. For example, a magician who falls to -1 Encyclopedic Magic
can no longer cast a spell that allows him to open his blank book and
read a magically-appearing encyclopedia entry on a specified topic. But
he can still cast spells using his Animal Empathy Magic, allowing him to
call and converse with wild animals, provided that Potential is still 0
or greater. He must still make a Constitution check for every day he his
active, however, to see if his -1 Encyclopedic Magic Potential is
causing him wounds.

<P>
Magic Potential may be recharged only by resting for one week per
level. (GMs may alter this time to taste, of course: resting for one day
is sufficient for more epic campaigns.) For example, a magician falls to
-1 Potential. Resting one week will bring him up to 0 Potential (and
cure any wounds incurred by being active while at -1 Potential). A
second week of rest will bring him up to +1 Potential.

<P>
No character may gain Magic Potential levels beyond his starting level
except through Character Development-- see Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node10.html#chap:chardevel">5</A>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001212000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:spells"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Spells
</H2> 
<P>
When a magician wishes to cast a spell, he describes the result he has
in mind. The GM assesses how powerful such an effect would be, based on
how prevalent magic is in her campaign. In a low-magic campaign, even a
simple spell such as levitating the jail keys to an imprisoned character
would be taxing. In a high-magic campaign, however, that would be a
trivial spell, and even shooting forth a flash of lightning from a
fingertip wouldn't be out of the ordinary.

<P>
The potency of the spell can be modified by the magician's appropriate
Power level. An ``average'' magician has three levels of appropriate Power
when casting a given spell. (Modify this number up or down for harder or
easier magic.) That is, a spell is more difficult for a magician with
less than three levels of an appropriate Power. Likewise, a magician
with four or more appropriate Power levels treats a spell as more
trivial than it would be for an average magician.

<P>
``Appropriate'' Power does not have to be all of the same specialization
so long as each Power governs the spell in question. For example, a
spell to make a sword fly up and attack a foe could be governed by
Flying Magic, Combat Magic, and Control Inanimate Material. If a
magician had one level of each of those types of magic, the spell would
be of average potency for him.

<P>
A spell is then Trivial, Average, or Potent. (It may also be Very
Trivial, or Very Potent, if the GM wishes. In fact, the players will
undoubtedly propose truly awesome spells, which should be labeled as
Extraordinarily Potent, or with some other impressive adjective.) The GM
tells the player what the potency of a proposed spell is-- any magician
character would have a fairly good idea of a spell's potency.

<P>
The spell's potency determines the Difficulty level. A spell of average
potency has a Fair Difficulty level, while a Potent spell has a
Difficulty level of at least Good. Likewise, a Trivial spell has a
Difficulty level of Mediocre or Poor.

<P>
The GM also decides the duration of the spell if it succeeds-- seconds,
minutes, hours, days, etc. The character may try to adjust this, subject
to GM approval. For example, the magician can voluntarily take more
fatigue or reduce the scope of the effect-- or accept some other
penalty-- to lengthen the spell's duration. Rolling a higher relative
degree can also mean the spell lasts longer. Some spells have permanent
effects: healing (until wounded again), busting a hole in a wall (until
repaired manually or by magic), teleporting to a distant place (until
you come back), and so on. Of course, even these spell effects may be
temporary in a given GM's world: healing only lasts a day and the wound
reappears, or a hole in the wall fixes itself after a few minutes, or a
teleported person automatically returns after an hour in the other
location....

<P>
The GM also needs to determine if there are any drawbacks to casting a
spell. Fudge Magic assumes that spells are tiring to cast, and a
magician reduces his Fatigue attribute when casting. The more potent the
spell, the more the fatigue. (Fatigue is regained by resting, of
course. If Fatigue goes below Terrible, the character passes out. The GM
may have separate Fatigue attribute, or base it on Endurance,
Constitution, Strength, etc.)

<P>
A GM who dislikes the idea of keeping track of fatigue can change the
drawback to something else. Perhaps a magician has a limited number of
spells he can cast in a day (or in an hour). In this case, he may have a
Spell Point attribute, which is drained by spell casting and regained
simply by the passage of time. (A trivial spell won't drain any Spell
Point levels, while an average spell drops a magician from Good Spell
Points to Fair, for example, and more potent spells drain two or more
levels at a time.) Draining spell points would not necessarily make the
magician tired in this case, and Spell Points would regenerate whether
the magician was resting or not-- or they might only regenerate with
sleep.

<P>
Or maybe each spell affects a magician's Sanity attribute, and he needs
to convalesce to restore it. Or, equally entertaining, a spell might
affect the sanity of anyone who witnesses magic! Reduced sanity can
manifest in many amusing ways....

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001213000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:mana"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Mana
</H2> 
<P>
Mana is an energy source capable of manipulating matter, time and
space. It can be tapped only by those with Magic Potential.

<P>
The GM determines the availability and density of mana in a given game
world, just as she does the average potency of a spell. Mana density can
affect two things: how large an area is needed to fuel a given spell
effect, and (optionally), how easy or hard it is to cast a spell.

<P>
When a spell of a particular effect is cast, the magician draws a
specific type of mana to him to create the effect. The next time this
same effect is desired, it will be harder to do: he has drained some of
that mana type in the local area.

<P>
The size of the area is defined by the GM. For most fantasy worlds,
assume it's about 50 yards or meters in diameter. In a low-level magic
campaign, the area is the size of a town or even city. (This would give
meaning to the old line, ``This town ain't big enough for both of us''--
dueling wizards!) On the other hand, a high-level magic campaign is so
mana-rich that the magician can simply take a step or two and be in a
new area. Note that the area governs which spells can be cast without
penalty: if one magician casts a healing spell, a second magician will
be at -1 to cast a healing spell in the same area within the next 24
hours. (Mana may recharge at a different rate in a given game world, of
course.) Note also that a magician may be unaware of what spells were
cast in an area before he arrived....

<P>
In a mana-rich area, spells may also be easier to cast: +1 or +2 to
skill level. Likewise, in a mana-poor area, spells can be harder to
cast: -1 or more. The GM decides if this rule is in effect.

<P>
Mana is dispersed and weak in a world such as modern Earth. The average
fantasy game world will have much stronger mana, and some high-magic
campaigns will simply reek of mana. In any given world, it is possible
to vary the amount of mana. Some lands may be mana-rich, while
neighboring areas are mana-poor. Mana may flow in currents, or in tides
with the phases of the moon. There may be ``rogue'' mana streams that
change course and invade new areas, or a mana drought may afflict a
given locale. Astrological alignments can affect mana, too-- thus even
here on mana-poor Earth there will be places and times of the year when
cultists gather to call forth unseen powers....

<P>
A PC magician would know the general mana level for at least his home
area. He may or may not know whether it fluctuates periodically, or if
far lands have different mana levels. In order to determine the mana
level of the local area at a given time, a magician must cast a spell
specifically to that end.

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Skill
</H2> 
<P>
Spell-casting is a skill that must be learned. The default is
Non-Existent, and, due to the element of uncertainty in Fudge Magic
(mentioned in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:fudgemagic">7.1</A>, Fudge Magic), the maximum
base skill level is Fair. This cannot be raised permanently-- but see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:spellcastingskillalternatives">7.193</A>, Spell-Casting Skill
Alternatives.

<P>
One generic Spell-Casting skill is assumed, but the GM may require more
if she breaks magic down into different types. It should cost one level
just to get a Spell-Casting skill at Terrible.

<P>
Spell-casting skill may be modified (to a maximum of Great) by the
following:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Taking an average time to cast a spell: +0. (Note: the GM assesses the
average time for any given spell proposed. Potent spells might take all
day, or even longer, while Trivial ones might take one to five minutes.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Taking a long time to cast a spell carefully: +1. (Relative to each
spell, of course. For a Trivial spell: taking a half an hour or more.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Casting a spell much more quickly than normal: -1. (For a Trivial spell:
one combat round of concentration.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Using normal effort to cast a spell: +0.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Using extra effort to cast a spell (more fatigue than normal, or counts
as two spells cast if there is a limit per day, or reduces Sanity more
than normal, etc.): +1 or +2.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Using less effort than normal to cast a spell: -1 or more. (Reduced
fatigue, or it only counts as half a spell against a daily limit, etc.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>First spell-casting of a particular effect in a given area within 24
hours: +0. (See Section 7.13, Mana, for the size of an area.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Additional spell-castings of a particular effect in a given area within
24 hours: -1 per casting.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>For using authentic magic formulae: +1. (The Law of Contagion or the Law
of Similarity, for example-- see James Frazer's classic anthropological
study, The Golden Bough. Both Laws require some physical component: a
feather to cast a flight spell, a piece of the subject's hair to heal or
hurt her, a drop of water that becomes a water jet, a stick that becomes
a staff, a bearskin to change the magician into a bear, etc. Drafting
the spell in poetical form earns an additional +1, if the GM is
willing.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Multiple magicians casting a spell that they have all tried before: +1
(for 2 to X magicians) or +2 (for more than X magicians). (X is set by
the GM, anywhere from two to ten, or even more for low-magic
campaigns. One magician is assumed to be the primary caster: roll only
once against his skill.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Mana-rich area: +1 or +2 (optional).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Normal mana area: +0

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Mana-poor area: -1 or more (optional).
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Other modifiers may also apply, such as in a spell to search the
mountains magically for someone you love (+1) or searching for someone
you've never met (-1).

<P>

<A NAME="sec:magicresolution"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Resolution
</H2> 
<P>
Each spell is then resolved as an Unopposed action: the Difficulty level
is dependent on the spell potency. Spells of average potency have a
Difficulty level of Fair, while more trivial spells have difficulty
levels of Mediocre or Poor. (No spell has a Difficulty level of
Terrible-- magic just doesn't work at that level.) More potent spells
have Difficulty levels of Good to Superb, or even beyond Superb if a
truly powerful effect is desired.

<P>
If the magician surpasses the Difficulty level, the spell occurs as he
described it. The better the relative degree, the better the result. The
magician suffers -1 (or more) to his Fatigue attribute if the GM deems
the spell is fatiguing. (If the GM has chosen some other drawback, of
course, apply that instead.)

<P>
Sometimes a skill roll is then needed to do something with the end
result of a spell. For example, a fireball needs to be thrown
accurately: use the Throwing Skill and Ranged Weapon rules in Chapter 4.

<P>
If the magician equals the Difficulty level, then a watered-down version
of the spell occurs. Either it will have a short duration, or reduced
potency, or there is a time lag before the spell takes effect,
etc. There may be an unexpected side effect, though it won't be harmful
to the magician. There is no penalty for the magician beyond a possible
-1 or -2 to Fatigue, at worst.

<P>
If the magician rolls below the Difficulty level, however, he is
adversely affected. The energy inherent in mana lashes out at the
magician's psyche instead of being focused as desired. There may (or may
not) be some visible magical effect, but it will not be the desired
effect, and, if he rolled poorly enough, it may even be inimical to the
magician's goals-- or health....

<P>
On a failed roll, the magician is stunned for one combat round (no
actions or defense) and takes at least -1 Fatigue. A Terrible result
always fails.

<P>
If he rolls a result of -4, the spell automatically fails (no matter
what the resulting level) and he also temporarily drains one level of
his Magic Potential-- see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:magicpotential">7.11</A>, Magic
Potential, for effects. (This is the ``riskiness'' of magic mentioned in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:fudgemagic">7.1</A>, Fudge Magic.)

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Examples: Barney casts a spell, Create Pizza, of Average potency in a
normal mana area and gets -3: a Terrible result. The spell fails and
Barney is stunned for a combat round, but he does not drain a level of
Magic Potential because he did not roll a -4. Later, in a mana-rich area
(+1 to cast), Barney takes a long time (+1) to cast Detect Food, a very
Trivial spell (Poor result or better needed for success). He has
temporarily raised his skill to Great, the maximum allowed. He rolls a
-4 result, which is a Poor rolled result. Although the rolled degree is
good enough to cast the spell, Barney still fails because he rolled a -4
result. Barney not only doesn't detect any food, he also exhausts one
level of Magic Potential-- ouch!

<A NAME="sec:personalmagicresistance"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN> Personal Magic Resistance
</H2> 
<P>
If the spell is one which attempts to Control another being-- either
mentally, physically or spiritually-- Opposed action rolls are also
called for. First, the magician casts the spell (as above); then he has
to overcome the Personal Magic Resistance of the subject. Magic
Resistance may be an attribute or gift (Willpower is a good choice, if
there is no specific anti-magic trait), as the GM desires. Magic
Resistance may even be a different attribute for different types of
spells (a mental attribute for attempts to control the mind, etc.). Note
that this second roll is Opposed-- the subject of the spell gets a
chance to resist it, and so can influence the result.

<P>
If the GM is willing, the magician may use the result he just rolled as
his skill level for the Opposed action. That is, if he rolled a Great
result on the spell, he rolls the Opposed action as if his skill were
Great. Otherwise, he uses the same level he rolled initially against.

<P>
``Control'' can mean many things to different GMs. Personal Magic
Resistance would resist an attempt to read someone's mind to one GM, but
not to another. However, Magic Resistance does not resist any spell that
calls or creates physical energy to lash out at another being. If the
magician successfully creates lightning to blast the subject, it is not
resisted by Personal Resistance; it is treated as a physical weapon.

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN> Certain Spell-Casting
</H2> 
<P>
Sometimes a magician desperately needs a certain result. In this case,
he may opt not to roll the dice at all, and simply drain one level of
Magic Potential for a guaranteed success. He takes the usual penalties
for losing a level of Potential-- see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:magicpotential">7.11</A>,
Magic Potential. This means he'll faint-- be unconscious-- after
casting the spell, which limits the utility for certain spells. You
can't control someone's mind when you are unconscious, for
example....

<P>
The GM may restrict this to Trivial spells, or non-Potent spells, or
have no restrictions at all, beyond requiring the normal fatigue (or
other) penalties. If the spell is one that could logically be resisted
by the subject, however, the subject still gets a Resistance roll. In
this case, the magician rolls as if his skill were Great.

<P>

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN> Enchanting Items
</H2> 
<P>
Items may be permanently enchanted in this system. The magician works
for a number of weeks or months (as required by the GM), depending on
the number and potency of the spells desired, and the general
availability of magic items in the campaign. At the end of each month
(or week), the magician rolls against two skills: Spell-casting, and the
appropriate Craft skill for the material being worked. The usual
penalties apply on failing a spell roll. If he surpasses the Difficulty
level on each roll, the spell is slowly being set into the item, one
stage at a time. On a roll that only matches the Difficulty level, the
work counts as only half a time period, but does progress the
enchantment.

<P>
Obviously, a mana-rich area will attract magicians, especially
enchanters.

These options offer ways to make Fudge Magic more sweeping, more
reliable, less risky, and even make it available to non-magicians.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">9</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Generalized Magic Potential
</H3> 
<P>
Some GMs may want the players to have sweeping powers. In this case,
each level of Magic Potential allows a character to try any magic effect
desired. This is in keeping with certain fictional settings in which
learning magic involves general principles rather than specific spell
effects. This makes for a very free and open game, which may or may not
be to your tastes.

<P>
This system still allows specializations. Simply use faults to limit a
magician's ability to cast certain spells. See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#sec:brogo">6.311</A>,
Character Examples, Brogo the Scout.

</H3> 
<P>
The GM may allow non-magicians to cast spells. In this case, it is
risky, as there is no Magic Potential ``cushion''-- one severe failure
is enough to devastate the character. Still, in an emergency, it may be
worth the risk. Such a character would still need to have some
Spell-casting skill, however. (But see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:spellcastingskillalternatives">7.193</A>, Spell-casting Skill
Alternatives).

<P>
As a substitute for Magic Potential specialization, the GM looks over
the character sheet (checking traits, personality, and character
background) and decides if a proposed spell would be appropriate for the
character. The character must have some aptitude in the proposed spell
subject, or he may not cast such a spell. For example, a trained fighter
with no knowledge of book learning or foreign languages could
conceivably try a combat spell, but not a spell to translate a book
written in an unknown script.

<P>
Of course, the same spell is of greater potency for a non-magician than
for a magician. This probably means that a non-magician will only have a
chance of casting a spell that a magician would consider trivial.

<P>
Since tastes differ, and Fudge Magic tends to be undependable (see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:fudgemagic">7.1</A>, Fudge Magic), three options are provided
for more reliable spell-casting:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Use the basic Fudge Magic system, but allow a magician to improve
   his chances of casting a spell beyond Fair. At a cost of one gift (or
   even supernormal power), this may be raised to Good. At a cost of two
   more gifts (or supernormal powers), casting skill may be raised from
   Good to Great, the maximum.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>GMs who want magic to be a lot more reliable can simply treat
   Spell-casting as any other skill. That is, it costs the usual skill
   costs to raise it to Good or even Great. Superb Spell-casting is not
   recommended for any but inherently magical races, even in high-level
   magic campaigns.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Spell-Casting is equal to the Willpower attribute, or perhaps
   Willpower-2. (There may still be a ceiling of Great, Good, or even
   Fair for Spell-Casting, regardless of the level of Willpower.) This
   is especially appropriate for games in which non-magicians can cast
   spells-- see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:magesandnonmages">7.192</A>, Magicians &amp;
   Non-Magicians. This is a potent option because the player doesn't
   have to buy Spell-casting skill for his character.
</LI>

To make spell-casting less risky (not necessarily a good thing-- see

Examples (apply as many or as few as desired):

<P>
Here is a sample miracle system (not generic), based on the following
premises mentioned in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node7.html#sec:miracles">2.6</A>, Miracles:

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Can miracles occur by petition:</SPAN> Yes.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Who can petition:</SPAN> Anyone. Holy persons have an advantage. (A
holy person is one with the supernormal power: Divine Favor, and whose
behavior is in synch with the deity's goals-- GM decision on how the
player is role-playing.) Religious Investiture-- a social title that
may or may not coincide with Divine Favor-- is not required, and, in
fact, does no good if behavior is inappropriate.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Certainty of petitioned miracles:</SPAN> Mediocre.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Broad or specific requests:</SPAN> Specific requests are more likely
to be granted.

<P>

<A NAME="sec:divinefavor"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Divine Favor
</H2> 
<P>
Divine Favor is a supernormal power that can be taken more than
once. Each time Divine Favor is taken, it is dedicated to a single
deity. It is possible to have Divine Favor from more than one deity in a
polytheistic world, or you can have multiple steps of Divine Favor from
a single deity. Each step of Divine Favor counts as two supernormal
powers (recommended).

<P>
Divine Favor can be temporarily lost if the character does not act in
accordance with the deity's desires. Usually a period of atonement is
required to regain Divine Favor. This may be instantaneous for a
merciful deity, or it may take up to a month for stricter deities. All
steps are lost and regained as a unit when this happens.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001222000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:petitioningamiracle"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Petitioning a Miracle
</H2> 
<P>
A character may petition a miracle at any time. However, some deities do
not like to be disturbed for trivial matters, and may ignore requests
when it is obvious the character hasn't even tried to help himself.

<P>
In Fudge Miracles, the petition should be fairly precisely
worded. Rather than a simple, ``Please help me,'' the character should
focus the plea: ``We are starving, please feed us,'' or, ``My friend is
dying, please heal him.'' A holy character can petition for any
miraculous result desired, however-- there is no established list of
miracles.

<P>
Characters without Divine Favor have a Petitioning skill of Poor (or
Mediocre in a more deity-active game). Those with one or more steps of
Divine Favor have a Petitioning skill of Fair. Petitioning skill cannot
be raised. (In a high-level deity-active campaign, Petitioning skill can
be raised to Good at the cost of one supernormal power.) Petitioning
skill can be modified, however-- see the next section.

<P>
To resolve a petition, make an Unopposed action roll against Petitioning
skill. Each step of Divine Favor grants the holy character one extra
chance to roll the dice in a petition to his deity.

<P>
On a Fair or worse result, the roll is a failure. If the character has
any steps of Divine Favor from the same deity, he may roll again for
each step (this does not count as a separate petition). He can stop at
any point-- only the last result rolled counts. This means a character
with two steps of Divine Favor can try one, two, or three rolls. If he
gets Good, Fair, and Mediocre results, in that order, the result of the
petition is Mediocre.

<P>
On a Fair or Mediocre result, the petition isn't answered by the deity,
but the deity isn't annoyed by the petitioner. On Poor or worse result,
however, the deity is angry with the character, and there will be a -1
on the next petition attempt. If the deity is evil, a miracle may
actually occur, but not one the petitioner is likely to enjoy....

<P>
On a Good or better result, the petition is granted. The better the
rolled result, the better the answer to the prayer. For example, a Good
result heals one wound or wound level, while a Superb result totally
heals the character. A Good result could call a wolf to defend the
petitioner, while three lions might answer a Superb result. And so on.

<LI>The petitioner's behavior has been strictly in accordance with the

fireball from a fire god, for example. This is not appropriate for a
Supreme God, whose sphere encompasses all things.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The petition involves an element antagonistic to the deity: -1 or more
(asking the Fire deity to use water, for example.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The petition is phrased too generally: -1 or more

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The petitioner has not tried to help himself first: -1 or more.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The petition is too trivial to bother the deity with: -1 or more

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The petition is a simple, but important, request: +1, provided the
petitioner has exhausted his own abilities to accomplish this
task. (Example: requesting a piece of chalk, which is trifling, but
simply cannot be found anywhere near the character. In this case, chalk
would have to be essential to the character's state of body, mind or
soul.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The last petition was a Poor or worse result: -1

<P>

<LI>The deity feels the petitioner is calling for help too frequently: -1 or

</H1> 
<P>
Date: February, 1993 &amp; December, 1993

<P>
By: Shawn Garbett and Steffan O'Sullivan

<P>
There are three types of Psi traits in this system: Powers, skills, and
Psychic Reservoir. Only psionicists have Powers and the skills to
activate them, but everyone has a Psychic Reservoir to resist psionic
attacks.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001231000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:psionicpowers"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Psionic Powers
</H2> 
<P>
The GM must decide how precisely to define Psi Powers. Since each Power
must be bought separately, defining them broadly makes for more powerful
characters.

<P>
The following chart (see right) shows some broad groups that include
more narrowly defined Psi power groups listed with them. These in turn
contain even more narrowly defined powers, which a GM may use as
individual Powers if desired. This list may be regrouped, expanded, some
powers disallowed, a narrowly defined group made into a broad group that
includes other powers, etc. The list is not intended to be
comprehensive, but merely a sample.

<P>
The GM should let the players know what depth of Psi skills she is
using. Each Power costs one Supernormal Power (two gifts).

<P>
Putting one level in a Power gets it at Terrible. Powers may then be
raised at the cost of two skill levels per level, if using the Objective
Character Creation system. For example, raising Telekinesis Power to
Poor requires two skill levels, and raising it to Mediocre would cost
two more skill levels.

<P>
If a GM envisions a psi-rich campaign, of course, the costs should be
much cheaper. Allowing many free levels of Supernormal Powers is a good
way to do this, but be cautious about trading them for mundane traits.

<P>
Power levels define range, quantity or size of subject affected, etc.--
see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node7.html#sec:psi">2.7</A>, Psi. A Fair Power can do whatever the default
average is for the campaign world.

<P>
Some tasks require a minimum Power level, as set by the GM. If the
character has the Power, but not at the minimum level required, he may
not attempt the action unless he uses Desperation Psionics
(Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:desperationpsionics">7.35</A>). If the psi has the appropriate
Power at three or more levels above the minimum required, he is at +1
for that use.

<P>
No psionic ability can be used unless the character has the Power listed
on his character sheet.

<P>
A character may take a latent psi Power at the cost of one gift. He
can't use the Power (may not take any related psi skills), but later in
the campaign he may spend EP equal to another gift to awaken the
Power. He would then have to learn the skills to control the Power.

<P>
It is also possible to take some interesting faults that will limit the
nature (and reduce the cost) of any Power. ``Usable only in emergencies''
is a common theme in fiction, for example.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Psionic Skills
</H2> 
<P>
You cannot attempt any psionic action unless you have the specific skill
to control the Power in question. Each Power must have an accompanying
skill of corresponding broadness or narrowness (Control Telekinesis, Use
Telepathy, Read Minds, etc.).

<P>
The default for psionic skills is Non-existent. Raising a skill to
Terrible costs one skill level, etc. Skills may be taken as high as Fair
at the beginning of a game. (The GM may allow higher levels if the
campaign is centered around psionic abilities.) They may be improved
through normal character development, and new ones may be added if the
GM is willing. The player should have a good story concerning awakening
new skills, however.

<P>

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Psychic Reservoir
</H2> 
<P>
Psychic Reservoir is a measure of raw psi power available. Like most
attributes, Psychic Reservoir is at Fair for every character unless
deliberately altered. The GM may set the default lower, and there may be
a ceiling on how high Psychic Reservoir can be set.

<P>
Merely having a Psychic Reservoir attribute does not mean the character
is capable of actively using psi. Other psionic Powers and skills are
necessary to activate the Psychic Reservoir.

<P>
A low Psychic Reservoir can negatively modify any active psi ability,
while a high Reservoir can be tapped to increase your chances of
success-- see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:psimodifiers">7.36</A>, Psi Modifiers Summary.

<P>
A psionicist taps his Psychic Reservoir when he uses a psychic
skill. Ongoing use gradually drains a Reservoir, and short but
heavy-duty use of a psi Power also drains a Reservoir, but normal brief
use doesn't. However, a rolled degree of Terrible or worse on a psionic
skill roll always lowers Psychic Reservoir a minimum of one level.

<P>
A psionicist can also attempt to drain his Psychic Reservoir
deliberately. This may be done to gain a bonus to a psionic skill (see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:psionicactions">7.34</A>, Psionic Actions), or to a Power (see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:desperationpsionics">7.35</A>, Desperation Psionics).

<P>
There is no immediate penalty for dropping a level of Psychic Reservoir,
as long as it remains Terrible or higher. However, your next use of psi
may be affected: there is a negative modifier for using a Psychic skill
when your Psychic Reservoir is below Fair.

<P>
If the Psychic Reservoir is drained to below Terrible, the character
immediately loses consciousness. It requires a Good roll versus a
Constitution attribute to regain consciousness, which may be attempted
every combat round.

<P>
Even after regaining consciousness, a character with Psychic Reservoir
below Terrible is in trouble. The GM may impose any type of affliction
she desires on such a character until the Psychic Reservoir reaches at
least Terrible. Suggested afflictions include mild insanity
(hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, etc.), physical debility
(drooling, shaking, twitching, etc.), attribute reductions, and negative
modifiers for even non-psi actions.

<P>
A character can regain one level of his Psychic Reservoir for each week
(or day, or whatever the GM sets) of rest, up to his current maximum
level.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001234000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:psionicactions"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Psionic Actions
</H2> 
<P>
Two kinds of psionic action are possible, Opposed and Unopposed.

<P>
An Opposed action is a psionic attack upon an unwilling subject. The
attacker rolls against his specific psionic skill, and defender rolls
against a Willpower attribute to resist. (A defender may have an
appropriate psi skill to use instead, such as Mind Shield.) An example
of an Opposed action would be an attempt to create fear in someone.

<P>
Unopposed psionic actions usually target inanimate objects. An Unopposed
action could be as simple as examining an object psychically, or as
complex as opening a dimensional door at one's feet. Telekinetically
hurling an object at a foe is an Unopposed action because the object,
not the foe, is the subject of the psionic skill.

<P>
When a Psi wishes to use an ability, the player describes the result he
wants to the GM. The GM then assigns a Difficulty level to the
action. Even if a psi overcomes a defender's Willpower roll to resist,
he must still roll the Difficulty level or higher to succeed at a task.

<P>
There may also be a minimum Power level needed in order to attempt an
action. For example, telekinetically lifting a pencil might only require
a Terrible Telekinesis Power, but lifting a large book might require a
Mediocre Telekinesis Power, and lifting a car might require a Superb
Telekinesis Power. If the psi's Power level is three or more above the
minimum needed, he gets a +1 to his skill level.

<P>
Note that mentally lifting a pencil might only require a Terrible Power
level, but manipulating it to sign one's name would probably require a
Superb skill result. To accurately forge another person's signature
would not only require a Superb Telekinesis skill result, but also a
Fair or better Forgery skill result.

<P>
The time required to activate a psionic ability depends on the potency
of the desired effect and the Power level of the character. It is set by
the GM. This can range from a single combat round to hours of
concentration. The individual can also vary the time concentrating
(which must be uninterrupted) to speed up the results or increase the
chances of success-- see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:psimodifiers">7.36</A>, Psi Modifiers
Summary.

<P>
The Psi now applies all modifiers and rolls against the Difficulty level
using the appropriate skill. In an Opposed action, both parties involved
make their rolls. On tie results, the status quo is maintained, whatever
that may be.

<P>
At this point, a psi (or animate target of a psionic attack) may attempt
to sacrifice one or more levels of Psychic Reservoir to augment his
rolled result. That is, if a psi fails in an Unopposed action, he may
stress himself in an attempt to succeed. In an Opposed action, this can
be considered two people locked in psionic combat, each struggling to
boost their power a bit to overcome the other.

<P>
To augment a rolled result, a Psionicist rolls against the psionic skill
he just used, with current modifiers still effective. If the result is
Good, he may sacrifice one level of Psychic Reservoir to give him a +1
on the result of the skill attempt. On a result of Great, he may
sacrifice one or two levels, gaining +1 for each level, and on a roll of
Superb or better, he may sacrifice up to three levels of Psychic
Reservoir. On a result of Fair, Mediocre or Poor, there is no effect: he
may not sacrifice a level of Psychic Reservoir, but there is no penalty
for having tried. On a result of Terrible or worse, however, he not only
drains one level of Psychic Reservoir, he also loses one level of rolled
result. This can intensify any negative consequences of having failed.

<P>
If one party of an Opposed action is successful in augmenting his rolled
result, the other may then try to augment his. They may continue to
trade sacrificing levels of Psychic Reservoir until one of them fails to
change the result, or falls below Terrible Psychic Reservoir.

<P>
Someone defending with no psionic abilities rolls against Willpower-2 to
augment his result.

<P>
Once augmenting-- if any-- is complete, the GM decides the duration of
the effects-- the better the roll, the better the results. Some effects
will be permanent, such as Healing. Continuous concentration may be
required to sustain other effects; this may slowly drain one's Psychic
Reservoir.

<P>
Psionic abilities are sometimes dangerous to use. A rolled degree of
Terrible or worse will usually result in the exact opposite of the
desired outcome, or some other entertaining backfire. In addition, the
psi loses one level of Psychic Reservoir, as outlined in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:psychicreservoir">7.33</A>. It may also have a gruesome result:
brain hemorrhage, loss of sanity, or a similar outcome. A Terrible
result on an Opposed psionic action can mean the loser is now
psychically open to his opponent. Such an open channel to another's
psyche means that if the winner has any psychic ability at all, he can
automatically draw on the loser's Psychic Reservoir to power his own
abilities. The GM should determine these effects based on the situation
at hand.

<P>

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Desperation Psionics
</H2> 
<P>
Ordinarily, if the minimum Power level of a proposed psionic action is
higher than the character's Power level, the psionicist may not attempt
the action at all. However, if one is desperate enough, he can try it--
at a great price.

<P>
For each level of Psychic Reservoir voluntarily drained before the skill
roll, a psionicist can increase his Power level by +1. Simply pushing
the Power level up to match the minimum level needed is all it takes to
try the skill-- but he is at -2 to his skill for each level of Psychic
Reservoir he drained for this attempt.

<P>
Unlike augmenting a rolled result (as described in the previous
section), draining one level of Psychic Reservoir before the die roll is
automatically successful.

<P>
This is obviously not for casual use: the risk of a Terrible outcome is
much higher than normal, as well as the guaranteed drain on Psychic
Reservoir. Nonetheless, if one were being attacked by the Spawn of The
Other, a demon of tremendous power, one might try anything to survive.

<P>
Yardmower Man wants to mow the lawn psionically-- he needs the
practice. He currently has a Good Psychic Reservoir and an interesting
assortment of psi Powers and skills. The GM decides that to move and
control the yard mower is a Great Difficulty level task on Telekinesis
skill. It requires only Mediocre Telekinesis Power, however. Yardmower
Man has a Good Telekinesis Power but only Fair Telekinesis skill. It may
be tough to do it well, but he's willing to try it.

<P>
Yardmower Man declares he's going to spend twice as much time
concentrating (+1) and is also under the influence of Batch-5, a
psi-enhancing drug (+1). He rolls a -1 result, which means a Good
Telekinesis effort due to his modifiers. He just missed the Difficulty
level. Since his power is adequate to move the lawn mower, he still mows
the lawn telekinetically, but doesn't do a very good job. In fact, it
looks sloppy: there are thin strips of unmowed grass here and there, and
he took out half of his daisy bed with one poorly aimed swipe.

<P>
Since this is a continued use, the GM decides that for each hour spent
mowing he reduces his Psychic Reservoir by one level. It takes him two
hours.

<P>
The next day, Yardmower Man decides the director of the local government
psionic research facility should be Molecularly Rearranged. (He's always
snooping around, and has been known to lock up psis in the past.) The GM
rules that Molecularly Rearranging a human other than the Psi himself is
a Superb Difficulty level task against the Shapeshift skill, and
requires at least a Great Shapeshift Power. It is also a taxing thing to
do: it will drain one level of Psychic Reservoir at the end of the
action. It will be opposed by the director's Presence attribute, which
is as close as this campaign comes to willpower.

<P>
Fortunately for Yardmower man, he has the Shapeshift Power and skill
both at Superb level. He also consumes a double dose of Batch-5, giving
him a +2 in the Opposed action, but severely risking side effects. His
Psychic Reservoir is down to Mediocre from activities the night before
(-1 to skill). Yardmower man rolls a -1 Result. This is modified -1 for
low Psychic Reservoir, and +2 for Batch-5, giving him a Superb Result.

<P>
The poor director has a Good Presence and Fair Psychic Reservoir. He
gets lucky and rolls a Great Presence result trying to resist the
psionic attack. But Great is not good enough (Yardmower man got a Superb
result), so he tries to augment his result by sacrificing a level of
Psychic Reservoir to fight the rearrangement of his molecules. His
sacrifice roll (against Presence) is a Good Result, so he increases his
result to Superb. He's still holding on, but just barely. Also, his
Reservoir will be Mediocre after this round of psychic combat.

<P>
Yardmower Man, not to be outdone, attempts to sacrifice his own Psychic
Reservoir. He started the combat with a Mediocre Psychic Reservoir and
full of Batch-5, so he still applies the +1 overall modifier to his
Superb Shapeshift skill on his augmentation roll. He easily achieves a
Good Result, and he therefore augments his result to Superb+1. (After
this round, his Reservoir will also drop another level.)

<P>
The director desperately tries to augment his result again, but rolls a
Fair result: he's reached the limit of his ability to stave off
defeat. Yardmower Man rearranges the director into a lovely bush, and
stares blankly at the outcome. At this point, his Psychic Reservoir
drops one more level, as required by the GM for such a taxing action.

<P>
Since he lost one level of Psychic Reservoir augmenting his skill, and
another for the difficult Shapeshift action, Yardmower Man is now left
with a Terrible Psychic Reservoir; he'd better not try anything this
difficult for a while. Also, the GM demands a Good Difficulty level roll
against Constitution to avoid any unpleasant side effects from the
Batch-5 overdose. Yardmower Man gets a Mediocre result, missing by two
levels. The GM smiles at the player, and secretly jots down that the
next time he uses Batch-5, he'll hallucinate that the director has
returned to human form and is out to get him....

<P>
Yardmower Man may someday drain his Psychic Reservoir fighting someone
that isn't there.

</H2> 
<P>
Date: December, 1992

<P>
By: Ed Heil

<P>
Instead of creating characters before starting the game, create them as
the game progresses.

<P>
The GM assigns a number of skill levels available to a PC during a
session. This should be based on how finely the GM defines skills: about
10 to 15 for broad skill-group games, and maybe twice that for fine
skill-group games. These may be traded at the regular rate of 3 skill
levels = 1 attribute level, or 6 skill levels = 1 gift. Faults may also
be taken, subject to GM approval.

<P>
The players start with most of the character sheets blank-- simply write
out a brief sentence or two describing the character in a general
way. (``Jeb is a surly dwarf, a good fighter, who is out to make a name
for himself as a mean customer-- and pick up some loot on the way. He
likes to talk tough, and doesn't care much for halflings.'')

<P>
As the character is confronted with challenging situations, the player
must decide the level of the trait in question. For example, the PCs are
confronted with a ruined castle to explore, and all the players state
their characters are looking for hidden passageways. At this point, each
player must set his PC's skill in finding hidden passageways (however
the GM defines such a trait: Perception attribute, or Find Hidden skill,
or Architecture skill, etc.). Those who are not yet willing to set such
a trait must stop searching: if you use a trait, you must define it.

<P>
Since setting an initial skill at Fair level uses up two skill levels,
and setting it at Superb uses up five levels, one must carefully weigh
spending levels on skills as they are used versus saving them for
emergency situations.

<P>
As usual, attributes are considered Fair unless altered, and most skills
default to Poor. Taking a trait at a level below the default adds to
your available skill level pool, of course. However, you may only define
a trait as it is used in a game situation.

<P>
Experience points are given out as usual, but EP awarded are reduced by
any unused skill levels after each session. That is, if you have two
levels left after the first session, and the GM awards you three EP, you
only get one more level for the next session, since you already have two
levels unused. EP, in this case, can be used either to raise existing
skills, as discussed in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node10.html#sec:objectivedevel">5.2</A>, Objective
Character Development, or they can be used to add new skills, as
discussed in this section, above.

<P>
Note that it costs more EPs to raise an existing skill than it does to
define a previously undefined skill in this on-the-fly system. EP should
be slightly higher under this system than a regular character creation
system, perhaps a range of up to ten per session.

  Resolution
</H2> 
<P>
Date: May, 1995

<P>
By: Reimer Behrends

<P>
This section handles ways of resolving conflicts without resorting to
the use of dice. There are reasons to do away with dice: some people
find dice mechanics too intrusive for play; others may want to get rid
of randomness altogether.

<P>
However, diceless action resolution is ill-suited to simulation-based
gaming, despite the fact that the game can (and should) feel just as
real as one with dice. Also, diceless resolution is usually more
demanding of the GM than rolling dice to select an outcome. Even more so
as there is no hard-and-fast rule for resolving conflicts without dice;
instead, some creativity is required of the GM to fill in certain
blanks.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION001242100000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:dicelessbasics"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Basics
</H3>

<P>
The basic idea behind diceless action resolution is simple: the GM
decides upon an appropriate outcome, based on player input and the
situation at hand. The details of this, however, can be more
complicated.

<P>
The idea is to use cause and effect to convey the feeling that whatever
happens to the characters is not due to whim, but occurs because of the
logic of the situation and the relevant history of everyone involved. It
is important that any event (with exceptions, of course) appears to a be
a logical effect of the preceding events. There is usually not a single
event that is the outcome. The GM has to choose between several possible
outcomes-- which may vary wildly in terms of success and failure.

<P>
Consequently, the two most important parts in resolving an action are
the reasons for a particular outcome and the consequences of that
outcome.

<P>
Reasons are numerous. Foremost among reasons for success and/or failure
is of course effective skill. However, a game where a sufficiently
skilled character always wins and an incompetent character always fails
would be quite boring due to its predictability. So we have to diversify
these results, but in a way that doesn't feel artificial.

<P>
We do this by accounting for other factors besides effective
skill. These factors can involve the environment (slipping in a puddle),
equipment (a gun that jams at a critical moment), time constraints
(defusing a bomb before it goes off), NPC actions (a character stepping
in the way), etc. The idea is not to account for all possible factors,
just to find one or two reasons that make the outcome seem logical.

<P>
Detailed description is essential to diceless action resolution--
description not only of the environment, but also of the
characters. Noting that a character has a Great fencing skill may often
suffice, but it is better to add some details (ideally through a
character history). Describe style, weaknesses, and strengths, even
though they may normally not show up on the character sheet. The same is
true for the description of important actions.

<P>
Sometimes a character's perception (or lack thereof) may result in
failure to notice why something happened. If, for instance, the floor
suddenly gives way beneath him, he may not be certain as to what caused
this to happen: did he step on a trap, or was there an outside agent
involved? In this case, the GM will hide some or all of the reasons.

<P>
In addition to reasons, we have to consider consequences: what impact
does a particular outcome have on the situation as a whole? The more
serious the outcome, the more the reasons for it happening need to be
convincing.

<P>
As an extreme example, death of player characters should only occur with
ample forewarning of the risks or with really compelling reasons. Of
course, jumping off a skyscraper will most likely render a character
dead the instant he hits the ground. This is acceptable, because the
players understand the logic of the situation. But slipping on a wet
rock while crossing a stream-- which can be ascribed to just plain bad
luck-- shouldn't kill a character outright. While it's true that
slipping on a wet rock probably happens more often than jumping off a
building, the GM needs to be careful in deciding the consequences of
such an action.

<P>
There are many possible results for typical actions. So, lacking clear
ideas as to which one is most appropriate-- maybe even torn between
clear success and catastrophic failure-- how can this selection be
narrowed down?

<P>
There are a few ways to approach the problem, and it is a good idea to
reach an agreement with the group before play commences as to what
factors will be used. The following list is far from complete, but gives
some possibilities:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Realism: A master archer will hit the target most of the time. But
   sometimes even he will fail, or even have a streak of bad luck. This
   is important for maintaining a feeling of realism in the long run. It
   should also be noted that realism is relative to
   genre. Chandelier-swinging is likely to succeed in a swashbuckling
   romp, while it is at best a risky endeavour in a gritty game.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Drama: Sometimes certain outcomes are dramatically more appropriate
   than others. This unfortunately depends to a great degree upon
   individual gaming style and can only be handled briefly here.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>) Characterization: Sometimes, a character's success or failure at a
   particular task can help to reinforce or develop his character story.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Theme: By assigning a certain ''theme'' to each scene in the game as it
   is encountered, actions can be resolved in a way that emphasizes that
   theme. An example:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[The theme is ``Combat is dangerous'']
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>GM: ``Suddenly, you hear a rustling in the underbrush, and then, out of
it, a boar emerges, charging at you.''
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Player: ``I'm not armed! I'll jump for the branch of the oak next to me
and pull myself up to safety.''
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[While the avoidance of a fight supports the theme, ``Combat is
dangerous,'' there are other possibilities that emphasize it better.]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>GM: ``You get hold of the branch, but as you start to pull yourself up,
you hear a loud CRACK, and all of a sudden the ground rushes upwards to
meet you.''
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[The situation is now much more dangerous. However, with a bit of luck
and the help of the other characters in the group it is still possible
to handle it without killing the PC.]

</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
All of the above factors are meta-game issues. This is
intentional. These factors contribute towards an interesting game, and
one of the points of role-playing is to have an interesting
game. Besides, we are already using the in-game factors as cause and
effect to convey a natural flow of events so we have to resort to the
meta-level here.

<P>
It may look as though there is a lot of arbitrariness on the part of the
GM. This is correct to some extent. Some individual decisions will be
arbitrary. In the long run it should balance out, especially if the
players possess even the slightest creativity. Note also that the GM
should always respect player input. If something is going to fail that
should normally work, failure should still reflect player input. (For
instance, the example above with the breaking branch, where the
character technically succeeds, but the branch does not cooperate).

<P>

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Balance Of Power
</H3> 
<P>
There is no need to encumber the GM with all the decisions. The easiest
way to hand some power back to the players is to give them a (limited)
voice in the decision making process. For this purpose we employ Fudge
Points (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node6.html#sec:fudgepoints">1.36</A>).

<P>
By spending one Fudge Point, the player (instead of the GM) can decide
the outcome of an action his character is involved in, provided the
action is possible and not abusive to the game. (Blowing up an entire
building with a cup of gunpowder is implausible, and possibly abusive to
the plot). If the action is far beyond the normal skill of the character
(given the circumstances), the GM may require expenditure of two or
three Fudge Points instead.

<P>
Notice that using Fudge Points also gives the GM more leeway; she need
no longer worry too much whether letting a character fail is too harsh,
as it is within the power of the player to help his character if need
be.

<P>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Combat
</H3>

<P>
Diceless combat is action resolution with two added complications: the
high risk of character death and a considerable amount of action that
needs to be synchronized.

<P>
The synchronization part is fairly easy: as in resolution with dice, you
can divide the entire combat in rounds of appropriate duration, cycling
through all participating characters each round, or use story elements
as suggested in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node9.html#sec:storyelements">4.21</A>.

<P>
Character death is trickier because players dislike losing their
characters due to bad luck (be it because of an unlucky die roll or GM
whim). The key here is to ``post warning signs'' before dangerous
situations occur. These warnings should be subtle, such as the maniacal
gleam in the opponent's eyes just before she launches a wild flurry of
attacks. (Hopefully the player will say his character is on the defense,
or announce some trick to counter a charge.) A description of the blood
dripping from a character's wrist should warn the player that there may
be a slippery puddle on the floor. In other words, prepare reasons for
outcomes in advance and-- most important-- announce them to the players.

<P>
If the players maintain some maneuvering space for their characters
after such warnings, that should be sufficient to prevent PC death--
though not necessarily PC failure.

<P>
Character death-- and any other drastic result-- is usually due to a
series of failures, each pushing the character a step further towards
the edge-- but always with opportunity to find a more favourable course
of action in between. Unfortunately, in some situations this entire
series of failures takes no longer than a few seconds.

<P>
The details of combat interaction are now fairly easy to handle, as they
are an extension of normal diceless resolution. However, particular care
should be taken to describe actions fully, especially in melee
combat. The statement ``I attack the pirate'' is infinitely less
informative than saying, ``I assault the pirate with all I have, even if
that means taking a blow or two myself. But I have to get out of here,
and that means getting by her and at least wounding her so she can't
follow quickly.''

<P>
The object is to give the GM enough data to work with, such as, ``I'm
going to feint towards the left, and if she goes for it, I'll try to use
the opening created to end this business quickly,'' or ``Now that she's
wounded, I'll play it safe, trying to wear her down.'' Statements like
these help the GM decide how combat should be resolved much more than a
simple, ``I attack her.''

<P>
The key here is to be creative. Everything is possible, so everything
should be considered, from a simple rugby tackle to complex tactical
maneuvering.

<P>
Bloodshed is an unfortunate but largely unavoidable side effect of
combat. Wounds are also important because they may become major factors
in the future course of the combat. Thus, wounds must be described and
their effects detailed. For example:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>``The ball of fire explodes in the centre of the room. You feel a wave of
searing heat washing over you, burning your clothes away and scorching
your skin. The heat gradually abates, but you still cannot see anything,
as the incredible brightness that hurts your eyes is only slowly
receding.''

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The player should gather from this that his character is temporarily
blinded, in severe pain, needing medical attention, in a state of
dishabille, and in grave danger if enemies are approaching.

<P>
(This is of course appropriate for a high fantasy game. In a more
realistic game, the character is probably charred and dead.)

<P>
Another example, this time a sniper's bullet hitting the character's
arm:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>``Something very hot and painful pierces your left arm. It also jerks you
around abruptly, making it hard to maintain balance. Worse, your arm
feels totally numb and is probably fairly useless right now. The good
news is that they (whoever they are) apparently missed your heart by a
few inches.''

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
And so on. There is no need to be too graphic in describing wounds,
though. More important is the description of how the wound affects the
character.

<P>

<P>
Fudge is ideally suited to diceless action resolution since it's already
simple and word-based. This can set the tone for the amount of
description necessary for a diceless game to succeed. Once players and
GM get used to diceless Fudge, they'll find themselves describing their
characters and actions in ways they never thought of before-- and the
game can be richer and more entertaining for it.

<P>
As a simple variation on any dice technique, allow players who roll a +4
result to roll again. If the result is positive, add it in to the +4
already rolled. If the result is negative or zero, ignore the second
roll. This allows a small chance of results up to +8, which can be
lifesaving in a dire situation.

<P>
Only a pitiless GM would balance this by requiring additional rolls to
see how miserably a person can do on a -4 result, however.

By: Peter Bonney &amp; Steffan O'Sullivan

<P>
If a PC is hit, he may reduce the effect of the hit by one wound level
by throwing himself heroically out of the way of (at least part of) the
blow. However, this heroic evasion will put the fighter at a temporary
disadvantage: -2 on the next combat round in addition to any other
penalties that may be accrued. This penalty disappears in subsequent
rounds, as the hero is able to recover his equilibrium after a brief
flurry of wild parrying. This may be repeated, but there is an
additional -1 for every turn in succession that this is used.

<P>
For example, D'Artagnan would be hit by Milady for a Light Wound (Hurt
result). He heroically evades, taking only a Scratch, but is at -2 on
the following round. In this round, he would be Very Hurt, but again he
heroically evades, taking instead a Hurt result. The next round he is at
-4: -2 for evading this round, an additional -1 for evading two rounds
in a row, and -1 for being Hurt. If he can avoid having to evade on the
next round, he'll only be at -1 for being Hurt. Good luck D'Artagnan!

<P>
If the penalty for an heroic evasion drops a fighter's skill level to
below Terrible, he may still take the evasion. But he automatically
collapses: his weapon drops from his nerveless fingers and his throat is
helplessly exposed to the enemy for an instant death blow if the foe is
so minded. A plea for mercy may accompany such an evasion, but the
opponent isn't necessarily bound to honor such a plea.

<P>
Heroic Evasion can be used for major NPCs, too, of course.

Ordinary playing cards can be used to keep track of wounds. Give a
player one face-down card when his character is Hurt, and another
face-down card when his character is Very Hurt. He gets rid of them when
the character is healed. Face-up cards represent fatigue-- the character
is reeling from exhaustion. He gets rid of those by resting. (A
character becomes fatigued by physical or mental activity, work, stress,
etc. Casting spells, using psi powers, etc., may or may not count as
fatiguing mental activity.)

<P>
Each card the character has represents a -1 to traits that would
logically be affected until the third, which represents incapacitation.

<P>
The cards may also describe hit location, if desired: a black card is
the torso, while a red card means an extremity. The lower the red card,
the lower the extremity; the higher the red card, the higher the wound
on the body.
