<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN>. Character Development
</H1>

<P>
After playing a bit, perhaps each session, a player will want the
character to grow in abilities. At this point, a developing character
can exceed the initial GM-set skill limits (such as one Superb, three
Greats). There are two ways to handle character development, or
``experience,'' as it's often called.

<P>

</H1> 
<P>
When the player feels the character has accomplished enough to warrant
improving in some trait (and he feels he's been role-playing well), he
petitions the GM for permission to raise it. A trait can only be raised
one level at a time. A trait must be used more to raise it from Good to
Great than Fair to Good, and so on. It should be easier to raise a Skill
than an attribute.

<P>
Or the GM can simply award an improvement in a trait she feels deserves
to be raised. In these cases, there is never a corresponding reduction
of another trait-- this is character development, not creation.

In the Objective Character Development system, the GM can award
experience points (EP), which the player can trade in any way he wants
at the following rates:

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Raising an attribute:</SPAN>

<P>
Triple the cost for skills of the same level.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Adding a gift:</SPAN>

<P>
6 EP (or more) + GM approval.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Adding a supernormal power:</SPAN>

<P>
12 EP (or more) + GM approval.

<P>
A trait can only be raised one level at a time.

<P>
The GM may adjust these point levels as she sees fit and should require
that the player may only raise traits that were used significantly
during an adventure. If a long campaign is planned, these EP costs could
be doubled to allow room for character growth.

<P>
Defining skills narrowly will also ensure characters don't become too
powerful too quickly.

<P>
As a guideline, good role-playing should be rewarded with 1 to 3 EP per
gaming session, with a suggested upper limit of 4 EP for flawless
role-playing. Players may save EP as long as they wish.

<P>
Attribute levels may or may not affect EPs put into skills. For
simplicity, you can ignore attribute levels entirely when raising skill
levels. For greater realism, however, the GM can add a surcharge of +2
EP (or more) when a skill is raised above an appropriate attribute.

<P>
Example: Violet the Herbalist has Good Intelligence.  EP costs for
raising Herb Lore skill are normal until she tries to raise it to Great,
which is higher than her natural Intelligence. At that point, she must
pay +2 EP beyond what the table calls for: 6 EP to raise Herb Lore to
Great, and another 10 EP to raise it to Superb.

<P>
This proposal is recommended only for character development-- not for
character creation. The GM should inform the players at character
creation if this option is in force so they can plan their characters'
attributes accordingly.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Development through Training
</H1> 
<P>
Improving skills through EP is not always realistic, to be honest. A
gaming session might only cover a few hours of campaign time. Allowing a
character to improve one or two different skills from Fair to Good in
that time is far-fetched. But it's fun for the players, and
psychologically satisfying, and so recommended.

<P>
As an alternative, or in addition to the methods described above, the GM
may allow traits to be raised through appropriate amounts of training
time. This would require finding a teacher (which would cost money) or
taking an appropriate job (which may not be totally dedicated the skill
you wish to learn, and so take longer). It's also possible to learn
something on your own, but the GM should double the time required. If
using the Objective Character Development system, the GM may (or may
not) require that EPs be spent in this manner-- that is, you can't spend
EPs unless you also take the time to train.

<P>
The GM sets training time and costs, and difficulty of finding a
teacher. The teacher has two skills that must be considered: Teaching
skill, and the appropriate skill being taught. The player may need to
roll the dice to see how diligently the character studied the skill. The
die roll should be on an attribute such as Willpower, Drive, Zeal,
Wisdom, Self Discipline, Self Motivation, Psyche, Intelligence, etc. If
the player can give a valid reason why the character is extremely
motivated to learn this skill, the GM may grant up to +2 to the trait
tested. The GM may request a single die roll, or a roll per week, month,
etc. If multiple rolls are called for, at least half of them should
succeed to earn the skill improvement.

<P>
Example: Billy Blaster, space cadet, is back at the Academy after his
first tour of duty. He considers his Fair Laser Pistol skill to be
substandard. He takes a six-week training course in Laser pistol use,
taught by an instructor of Superb Laser skill and Great Teaching
skill. (Since Billy has Gift: Employed by Space Patrol, this is free
training for him.) The GM decides that Billy's player needs to make a
Willpower roll for each two-week period to see how dedicated he is to
studying. If at least two of the three rolls are Mediocre or better,
Billy can raise his Laser pistol skill from Fair to Good, given the
length of training and quality of the instructor. Had the training been
shorter, or the instructor worse, he would have needed a preponderance
of Fair or even Good rolls to have successfully raised his Laser pistol
skill.

<P>
Remember that it is much easier to improve a skill from Poor to Mediocre
than from Great to Superb. Require more time, or higher Difficulty
Levels on the Will rolls to raise an already high skill.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Note:</SPAN> The following was taken from the author's ``Thoughts on
Fudge'' (online at <A NAME="tex2html9"
  HREF="http://www.io.com/~sos/rpg/fudlatest.html"><TT>http://www.io.com/~
sos/rpg/fudlatest.html</TT></A>).

<P>
After a convention game one time, Ann Dupuis and I were discussing how
well the game went, especially with the one newcomer to gaming at the
table. The woman was not only at her first convention, but was playing
her first RPGs that weekend. Fudge was the last game in her schedule
that con, and she was blown away by how easy it was compared to the
other games. She said she understood the character sheet without having
to have anything explained to her-- and that the single mechanic to
resolve all actions was the best she'd seen in the five different games
she'd tried.

<P>
So we were congratulating ourselves, when I mentioned to Ann (President
and Dictator for Life of Grey Ghost Games) that Fudge did have its
drawbacks-- experience being the most glaring. Yes, it's great for
one-shot con games, but it seems to allow characters to develop too
quickly or not at all in long-term games.

<P>
Ann came up with an idea which we batted around a bit, and it looks
something like this:

<P>
Instead of awarding Experience Points, the GM awards Fudge Points at the
end of a gaming session. These can be turned in for Experience Points,
but the ratio in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node6.html#sec:fudgepoints">1.36</A> (suggested 3 EP = 1 Fudge
Point) is reversed. That is, you may turn in three Fudge Points for one
EP.

<P>
Raising traits is unchanged from Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="#chap:chardevel">5</A>.

<P>
What this does is force the player to consider whether he needs to save
his Fudge Points to get out of a jam the next session, or convert them
to EP to raise a trait. He can save Fudge Points from session to
session, so he can eventually swap 12 Fudge Points for 4 EP to raise a
trait or two-- but he may have to use some of those Fudge Points along
the way to survive!

<P>
The net effect is that character development is left totally in the
hands of the player, but is slowed down from the rate suggested in the
book. This means a long-term campaign becomes more viable in Fudge.
