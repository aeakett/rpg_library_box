<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>. Combat
</H1> 
<P>
Unless one participant is unaware of an attack or decides to ignore it,
combat is an Opposed action in Fudge. The easiest way to handle combat
in Fudge is as a series of Opposed actions. This can be done simply or
with more complexity. The author of Fudge uses simple and loose combat
rules in order to get combat over with quickly and get back to more
interesting role-playing. This chapter, largely optional, is for players
who prefer combat options spelled out in detail.

<P>
Melee combat and Ranged combat are treated separately.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Melee Combat
</H1> 
<P>
Fudge gives three options available for handling the pacing of melee
combat: moving from story element to story element, using simultaneous
combat rounds, or alternating combat turns. An individual GM may devise
others.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00921000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:storyelements"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Story Elements
</H2> 
<P>
In the simplest combat system, the GM explains the situation in as much
detail as is apparent, then asks the players to describe what their
characters are doing. The more complete the description of their
characters' actions, the better the GM knows how to assess the
situation. This can be important if she has something that won't berevealed until the middle of a battle. Die rolls, if any, are required
by the GM for each story element.

<P>
A story element is the smallest unit of time in this type of combat
resolution. The GM may break the battle down into several story
elements, or treat the whole encounter as one element. This depends on
the GM's style, the importance of the battle, the number of
participants, whether or not there are unexpected surprises, etc. Each
element should be a dramatic unit.

<P>
For example, the PCs are faced with a detachment of guards at the door
while the evil mastermind is trying to activate the Doomsday machine at
the back of the room. The fight with the guards might be one element
while the confrontation with Dr. Doomsday could be a second. Another GM
might treat the whole battle as one story element, while a third GM
would treat each 5-second segment separately. Whatever the number of
elements, keep the battle description as word-oriented as possible.

<P>
The GM may ask for a single die roll from a player occasionally, or
require three rolls and take the median roll.

<P>
(The median is the middle value die roll, which may be the same as
either the high or low die roll. For example, if the player rolls a
Good, a Mediocre, and a Superb result, the median is Good, since it's
the result in between Mediocre and Superb. But a result of Poor, Great,
and Great gives a median die roll of Great. Using a median tends to
soften the role of extreme luck. Some GMs use a median when a single die
result represents many actions.)

<P>
Once the GM has decided which trait (or traits) each PC should use for
this combat, she then gives them a modifier, ranging from -3 to +3. Zero
should be the most common modifier. The modifier is based partly on how
well the PCs' plan would work, given what the GM knows of the NPCs, and
partly on circumstances: fatigue, lighting, footing, surprise, weapon
superiority, bravery or cowardice of NPCs, wounds, etc.

<P>
Here is a long example of story element style of combat:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Gunner, separated from the other PCs, surprises five members of a rival
gang in a garage. The player announces that Gunner will shout and charge
the rival mob, carrying his Tommy gun as if he's about to fire-- they
don't know it's irreparably jammed. He hopes to see them run away, hit
the dirt, or freeze in fear. He'll then use his Tommy gun as a club,
starting at the left end of their line. He'll keep his current opponent
in between him and the others as long as possible. He hopes to then roll
up their line, one at a time, keeping the wall to his left side as he
charges.
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The GM makes a Situational roll for the mob: Mediocre. The mob members
don't recover quickly from their surprise, so she gives Gunner a +1 to
his Brawling skill of Good for this plan. She also decides that one
mobster will run away and the others won't draw their guns until Gunner
has already engaged the first enemy. His Running skill is Great, so she
gives him another +1, since he can cover ground quickly. Total modifier
for Gunner is +2, bringing his Brawling skill to Superb for this
combat. Since this is a fairly long action and she doesn't want a single
unlucky roll to ruin Gunner's chances, she asks him for three Brawling
skill rolls (at the +2 modifier), and to use the median roll.
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Gunner rolls a Good, Superb, and Great result, in that order. The median
roll is Great, and the GM decides this is good enough to have downed the
first two mobsters, and describes the battle so far in entertaining
detail. Now Gunner is facing the last two thugs, who finally have their
pistols out and could probably plug him before he charges that far. The
GM asks, ``What does Gunner do now?''
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Gunner hurls the Tommy gun into the face of one gunman while making a
low diving tackle for the other, hoping to dodge under any bullets. The
GM calls for a single roll against Brawling to cover this whole action:
Gunner gets a Fair result. The GM rules that Gunner throws the Tommy gun
well enough to distract one gunman, but not harm him. He does, however,
manage to tackle and subdue his other foe, whose shots all go wild.
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>At this point, the GM rules that the mobster grazed by the thrown Tommy
gun now steps over and points his pistol to Gunner's head while he's
kneeling over the other mobster. Gunner wisely heeds the call to
surrender and hopes his friends can rescue him....

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00922000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:simultaneouscombatrounds"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Simultaneous Combat Rounds
</H2> 
<P>
Those who like their combat broken down into discrete bits can use
combat ``rounds.'' In simultaneous action rounds, all offensive and
defensive maneuvers happen at the same time. This is realistic: few real
combats consist of fighters taking turns whacking at each other.

<P>
The GM determines which traits the combatants should roll against. This
depends largely on which weapon they are using, which might simply be a
fist. Weapon type also affects damage-- see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:wounds">4.5</A>,
Wounds.

<P>
Each combatant makes an Opposed action roll. On a relative degree of
zero, the combat round is a stand-off-- the fighters either circled each
other looking for an opening, or exchanged blows on each other's
shields, etc.-- nobody is hurt.

<P>
A minimum result of Poor is needed to hit a (roughly) equal-sized
opponent. That is, a human needs to score a Poor blow (and still win the
Opposed action) in order to hit another human. If both opponents roll
worse than Poor, the round is a standoff.

<P>
If one opponent is significantly bigger than the other (of a different
Scale, at least), he needs a Mediocre or even Fair result to hit his
smaller foe, while even a Terrible result will allow the small fighter
to hit the larger. (Of course, such a blow must still win the Opposed
action.) Extremely small targets, such as a pixie, may require a Good or
even a Great result. Examples include humans fighting giants, or very
large or small animals.

<P>
If the result is a relative degree other than zero, and the minimum
level needed to score a hit is achieved or surpassed, the winner checks
to see if he hit hard enough to damage the loser. In general, the better
the hit (the greater the relative degree), the greater the likelihood of
damage.

<P>
If one combatant is unable to fight in a given round (possibly because
he's unaware of the attacker, or because of a critical result in the
previous round-- see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node8.html#sec:criticalresults">3.6</A>, Critical
Results), the combat may become an Unopposed Action for the active
fighter, usually with a Poor Difficulty Level. If a character can defend
himself in some way, such as using a shield, it is still an Opposed
Action, but the defending character cannot hurt the other character even
if he wins the combat round.

<P>
Combat often takes more than one combat round. Characters are not
limited to attacking each round-- they may attempt to flee, negotiate,
try a fancy acrobatic stunt, or any other appropriate action.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00923000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:alternatingcombatturns"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Alternating Combat Turns
</H2> 
<P>
Using alternating combat turns, each combat round consists of two
actions: the fighter with the higher initiative attacks while the other
defends, then the second combatant attacks while the first defends. With
multiple characters involved in combat, the side with the initiative
makes all their attacks, then the other side makes all their attacks. Or
the GM may run the combat in initiative order, even if fighters from
both sides are interspersed throughout the combat turn.

<P>
Gaining initiative is an Opposed action. If the characters don't have an
Initiative attribute or skill-- such as Reflexes or Speed-- simply use
Opposed Situational rolls. A gift such as Combat Reflexes can grant a +1
to initiative. Surprise may grant a bonus to the roll, or give automatic
initiative. Initiative can be rolled once for each battle or once each
round. Perhaps a character could trade skill for initiative: attack
hastily (+1 to initiative that round) but be slightly off balance
because of it (-1 to attack and defend that round).

<P>
Each attack is an Opposed Action: the attacker's Offensive skill (Sword,
Melee Weapon, Martial Art, etc.) against a defender's Defensive skill
(Shield, Parry, Dodge, Duck, etc.). This type of combat take longer than
simultaneous rounds, but some players feel it gives a character more
control over his own fate.

<P>
Using these rules, a Defensive parry skill may simply equal the weapon
skill, or it may be a separate skill that must be bought independently
of an Offensive skill. The GM must tell the players at character
creation which method she is using-- or allow them extra levels on the
fly to adjust their defensive abilities.

<P>
Some weapons, such as an Axe, are poor parrying weapons. Players should
ask the GM at character creation if a weapon may be used to parry and
still be used to attack without penalty in the next turn-- and give
their characters decent Shield or Dodge skills to compensate for poor
parrying weapons.

<P>
All-out offensive and defensive tactics can be used. A character
forfeits his attack for a round if he chooses All-out defense, and is at
-2 on his defense on his opponent's next turn if choosing All-out
offense-- or perhaps gets no defense at all!

<P>
The default defense for animals depends on their type: carnivores will
usually have a Defense value one level less than their Offense, while
this is reversed for most prey species.

<P>

<A NAME="sec:meleeoptions"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Melee Combat Options
</H1> 
<P>
The various options listed below may be used with any melee system. This
is not a comprehensive or ``official'' list of options. The GM should, in
fact, consider these options merely as examples to stimulate her
imagination. The GM may wish to import complex combat options from other
games into Fudge.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00931000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:meleemodifiers"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Melee Modifiers
</H2> 
<P>
Some situations call for one side or the other's trait level to be
modified. Here are some examples:

<P>
A fighter who is Hurt is at -1, while one who is Very Hurt is at -2.

<P>
If one fighter has a positional advantage over the other, there may be a
penalty (-1 or -2) to the fighter in the worse position. Examples
include bad footing, lower elevation, light in his eyes, kneeling, etc.

<P>
Subtract the value of a shield from the opponent's weapon skill. A small
shield has a value of +1 in melee combat only, while a medium shield has
a value of +1 in melee combat and +1 to defense against ranged attacks
(if the shield material is impervious to the weapon). A large shield (+2
in all combat) is cumbersome to lug around. The larger the shield
carried, the more the GM should assess penalties for things such as
acrobatic and other fancy maneuvers. Shields can also be used
offensively to push an opponent back, for example, or knock someone
over.

<P>
Compare combatants' weapon sizes and shields (see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:samplewoundfactors">4.54</A>, Sample Wound Factors List). If one
fighter's weapon + shield value is +2 (or more) greater than the other
fighter's weapon + shield value, the fighter with the smaller weapon is
at -1 to his combat skill. (Example: one fighter has a Two-handed sword:
+4 to damage. His opponent has a knife and an average shield: +1 to
damage, +1 for shield makes a total of +2. The knife wielder is at -1 to
skill in this combat since his weapon modifier is -2 less than the sword
fighter's.)

<P>
Aiming at a specific small body part (such as an eye or hand) will
require a minimum result of Good or Great to hit and also have a -1 to
the trait level. If a result of Great is needed and the fighter only
gets a Good result but still wins the Opposed action, he hits the other
fighter-- but not in the part aimed for.

<P>
A fighter may have a magical blessing (+1 or more) or curse (-1 or
worse).

<P>
All-out offense, such as a berserk attack, grants a +1 to the combat
skill (and an additional +1 for damage, if successful). However, if an
all-out attacker ties or loses the Opposed action, the other fighter
wins, and gets +2 to damage!

<P>
An All-out defensive stance earns a +2 to the combat skill, but such a
combatant cannot harm his foe except with a critical result.

<P>
A successful All-out Defense and a successful Perception or Tactics roll
produces a -1 penalty to the opponent on the next round. The fighter
takes a few seconds to scope out the area and maneuvers to take
advantage of any terrain or conditional irregularity. Similar combat
subtleties are possible, and encouraged-- taking a successful All-out
defense one round can allow a player to try an acrobatics maneuver the
next combat round without risk of being hit, for example.

<P>

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Offensive/Defensive Tactics
</H2> 
<P>
This optional rule, used with simultaneous combat rounds, allows more
tactical flavor to combat at a small expense of complexity. This option
replaces the All-out attack and defense options listed above, and allows
for both combatants to be injured in the same combat round.

<P>
Before each round, a fighter may choose to be in a normal posture, an
offensive posture or defensive posture. An offensive or defensive stance
increases combat skill in one aspect of combat (offense or defense), and
decreases the same skill by an equal amount for the other aspect of
combat.

<P>
There are five basic options:

<P>

<DD>-2 to Offense, +2 to Defense
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Each combat round, a player secretly chooses a combat stance by
selecting two Fudge dice and setting them to a result from +2 to -2,
which represents an offensive modifier. (The defensive modifier shown
above with the offensive modifier is automatically included.) Both sides
simultaneously reveal their choices.

<P>
For those without Fudge dice, choose one die placed as follows:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">Die face:</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Option:</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">1</TD>

<TD ALIGN="LEFT">+1 to offense</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">6</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">+2 to offense</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
Each fighter then makes a single Opposed action roll as normal. The
result is applied to both offense and defense, however, and will thus
have different results for offense and defense if anything other than a
normal posture is chosen. The offensive rolled result of each fighter is
then compared to the defense of the other fighter.

<P>
For example, a fighter with Good sword skill chooses +1 to offense and
-1 to defense for a particular combat round: his offensive sword skill
is Great this round, while his defensive sword skill is Fair. His
opponent, a Great swordswoman, chooses normal posture. The swordswoman
rolls a -1: a Good result for both her offense and defense. The first
fighter rolls a 0 result: his offensive rolled result is Great, his
defense is Fair.

<P>
His offense result of Great is compared with her Good defense: he wins
by +1. However, her offense result of Good is simultaneously compared
with his defense of Fair: she also wins the Opposed action by +1. Both
sides check for damage, to see if they got through each other's armor--
see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:wounds">4.5</A>, Wounds.

</H2> 
<P>
If a PC is fighting an NPC the GM can treat combat as an Unopposed
action by assuming the NPC will always get a result equal to her trait
level. In this case, the PC will have to tie the NPC's trait level to
have a stand-off round, and beat the NPC's trait in order to inflict
damage. This option stresses the player characters' abilities by
disallowing fluke rolls by NPCs.

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Multiple Combatants in Melee
</H2> 
<P>
When more than one opponent attacks a single fighter, they have, at
least, a positional advantage. To reflect this, the lone fighter is at
-1 to his skill for each additional foe beyond the first. (For
epic-style games, with a few heroes battling hordes of enemies, this
penalty can be reduced, or the GM can simply give the hordes Poor skills
and low Damage Capacity-- which is not out of character for a horde.)

<P>
The lone fighter rolls once, and the result is compared with each of the
opponents' rolled degrees, one after the other. The solo combatant has
to defeat or tie all of the opponents in order to inflict a wound on one
of them. If he beats all of his foes, he may hit the foe of his
choice. If he ties his best opponent, he can only wound another whose
result is at least two levels below his.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Example: Paco is facing three thugs, who have just rolled a Great, Good,
and Mediocre result, respectively. Paco rolls a Great result, tying the
best thug. He hits the thug who scored a Mediocre result (at least two
levels below his result) and is not hit himself (he tied the best thug).

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The lone fighter takes multiple wounds in a single round if two or more
enemies hit him. Usually, he can inflict damage on only one foe in any
given round-- his choice of those he bested. It's also possible to allow
a sweeping blow to damage more than one foe at a time. Of course, this
slows a slash down: reduce damage done by 1 or 2 for each foe cut
through.

<P>
A well-armored fighter facing weak opponents can simply concentrate on
one foe and let the others try to get through his armor (that is, not
defend himself at all against some of his attackers). In this case, the
lone fighter can damage his chosen foe even if he is hit by other,
ignored foes. This is historically accurate for knights wading through
peasant levies, for example. There may or may not be a penalty for the
lone fighter in this case.

<P>
There's a limit to the number of foes that can simultaneously attack a
single opponent. Six is about the maximum under ideal conditions (such
as wolves, or spear-wielders), while only three or four can attack if
using weapons or martial arts that require a lot of maneuvering
space. If the lone fighter is in a doorway, only one or two fighters can
reach him.

<P>
When multiple NPCs beset a lone PC, the GM may wish to use the option in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:pcsvsnpcs">4.33</A>, PCs vs. NPCs. This will save a lot of die
rolling.

<P>
Alternately, she may wish to roll only once for all the NPCs. The lone
fighter is still at -1 per extra opponent. The GM rolls 2dF, and applies
the result to each NPC. For example, if the GM gets a +1 result, each
attacker scores a +1.

<P>
For those without Fudge dice, the GM could simply use the 1d6 method
discussed in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node8.html#sec:opposedactions">3.5</A>, Opposed Actions.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Example: Three NPC pirates, complete with eye-patches, scars, earrings,
sneers and generally bad attitudes, are attacking dashing PC hero
Tucker. The pirates (whose names are Molly, Annie, and Maggie) are Fair,
Good, and Mediocre, respectively, at combat skills. Tucker is a Superb
swordsman, but is at -2 for having two extra fighters attacking him at
once: his skill is Good for this combat. The GM wants to roll just once
(applying the result to all three pirates) rather than rolling three
times each combat round.
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Rolling 2dF, she gets a +1 on the first round. The pirates have just
gotten Good, Great, and Fair results, respectively. If Tucker scores a
Superb result, he could hit the pirate of his choice and remain
unhit. On a Great result, Tucker would be unhit, and could land a blow
on Maggie. On a Good result, he doesn't hit anyone, but Annie hits
him. If Tucker rolls a Fair result, both Molly and Annie would hit
him. The process is repeated each round.

<A NAME="sec:hitlocation"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Hit Location
</H2> 
<P>
A light blow to an eye is very different from a light blow to an armored
shoulder, or to a shield. Using a hit location system adds flavor to
combat and the description of a character's equipment, wounds-- and
scars! Many games have a hit location system, and a GM can easily
translate one she is familiar with to Fudge. Or she can use the simple
system given here.

<P>
The simplest system is not to worry about ``called shots.'' Merely say the
better the relative degree, the better the location of the blow. Winning
a battle by +8 will allow the attacker to pierce an eye, if
desired. Hopefully, the players will describe their actions in such
detail that the GM will know how close they came to their objective
merely by looking at the relative degree.

<P>
A more complicated system: an attacker can announce that he is aiming at
a specific body location-- this must be done before rolling to hit. The
GM decides the minimum relative degree necessary for such a shot to
succeed, usually ranging from 2 to 4, though extreme locations (such as
an eyeball) are harder to hit. So if a player wishes his character to
hit his opponent's weapon arm, the GM can respond, ``You have to win by 2
to do so.'' If the player then does win by relative degree 2 or more, the
weapon arm is hit, and the wound is specific to that arm.

<P>
If the attacker wins the combat round, but not by the minimum relative
degree needed to hit the called target, the defender names which part of
the body-- or shield!-- is hit. This will most likely be general body
(if there is no shield), but it could be the off-hand, which would carry
a lesser combat penalty than a wound to the torso. The GM may have to
fudge some here.

<P>
A damaged specific body part can be described as being Scratched (no
real game effect), Hurt (a penalty to use, but the body part still
functions), and Incapacitated. After battle is the time to decide if an
Incapacitated body part can be healed, or is permanently Incapacitated.

<P>
A Hurt body part is generally at -1 to its normal use. A Hurt sword arm
gives a -1 penalty to combat, for example, while a Hurt leg is -1 to any
running, acrobatics, etc. A Hurt eye is -1 to vision, and so on.

<P>
To determine the exact level of the damage, the GM should consider how
well the hit scored, as well as the Strength of the attacker and the
weapon being used. Winning by the minimum relative degree necessary to
hit the specific body part shouldn't make the victim Incapacitated
unless the attacker is of a much larger Scale than the defender. On the
other hand, an arm hit with a battle axe wielded by a large, berserk
Viking has a good chance of being cut off even if the Viking just rolled
exactly what he needed to hit the arm....

<P>
As a guideline, if the attacker surpasses the relative degree necessary
to hit the body part at all, the part is Scratched or Hurt, depending on
Strength and weapon deadliness. If he surpasses it significantly, the
part is Hurt or Incapacitated.

<P>
Species other than humans may have a different list of body parts to
hit, and/or different difficulty modifiers.

<P>

<A NAME="sec:fancystuff"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN> Fancy Stuff
</H2> 
<P>
A lot of fancy maneuvers are possible in Fudge combat. All require a bit
of thought on the GM's part.

<P>
What if you want a Speed or Reflexes trait to affect how often you can
strike in combat? How would you handle someone of Good Speed vs. someone
of Fair Speed?

<P>
If someone has a Power that speeds him up beyond the human norm, you can
simply have him attack every other round as if his opponent wasn't aware
of the attack. That is, every other round, an Unopposed result of Poor
or better hits the foe, with no chance to be hit back in return.

<P>
For more subtle differences, the GM may allow an Opposed action to
determine if one fighter gets to land a blow first: after declaring
their actions, each fighter makes a roll against a Speed trait. The
winner of the Opposed action, if any, adds the difference to his weapon
skill.

<P>
How about Fudge's ``graininess'' getting in the way of interesting combat?
That is, since there are only seven levels in Fudge, a Good fighter will
often meet another Good fighter, and it doesn't seem right that you
can't meet someone who's just a little better or worse than you.

<P>
In this case, the GM can create new levels of combat skills (there's no
point in using this option with other skills). These new levels require
full experience points to reach, but function only as ``half'' levels,
called ``plus'' levels. Thus, you can have:

<P>
And so on. In any combat, someone with a ``+'' has the skill level listed
before the ``+'', but gets a +1 every other round, starting with the
second round. So in a combat between Gus (skill Great) and Ivan (skill
Good +), Gus would have the higher skill on on rounds one, three, five,
etc. But on rounds two, four, six, etc., Ivan will roll as if he had a
Great skill, thus being Gus's equal those rounds.

<P>
What about swinging on chandeliers and other swashbuckling moves? Since
role-playing games have more to do with movies than real life, this
should be encouraged if the genre is at all cinematic.

<P>
In these cases, have the player describe his swashbuckling intentions as
fully and dramatically as he can. The better the story, the better the
bonus to the die roll-- or no roll needed if the outcome is entertaining
enough. You may then request a roll against Dexterity, or Acrobatics (or
even Chutzpah!) and let that determine how well he accomplished his
aim. Maybe the swing on the chandelier came off great, but the landing
on the banister was a little rough, so the slide down to slam the
villain in the back was a tad off, and instead of knocking him out, you
merely made him drop his weapon, but then fell on the floor yourself,
and now he's mad, and maybe you should get up before he picks up his
pistol, or you could try to yank the carpet while you're down there,
right next to it, and he seems to standing on it a bit off-balance?
Whatever is fun!

<A NAME="sec:rangedcombat"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Ranged Combat
</H1> 
<P>
Ranged combat may or may not be an Opposed action.

<P>
If the target is unaware of the assault, the attacker makes an Unopposed
action roll to see if he hits his target. The GM sets the Difficulty
Level based on distance, lighting, cover, etc. Do not modify the
attacker's skill for range, partial cover, or other circumstances--
that's included in the Difficulty Level. Equipment such as a laser
sighting scope can modify the attacker's skill, though.

<P>
If the defender is aware of the attack it is an Opposed action: the
attacker's ranged weapon skill against the defender's defensive
trait. (A Difficulty Level for range, lighting, etc., is still set by
the GM, and is the minimum rolled degree needed to hit.) A defensive
roll should be made against a Dodge skill, or Agility attribute, or
something similar.

<P>
If the ranged weapon is thrown, there is no modifier to the defense
roll. However, a propelled weapon, such as a bow, gun, or beam weapon,
is much harder to avoid. In this case, reduce the defender's trait by -2
or -3. Obviously, the defender isn't trying to dodge a bullet, but
dodging the presumed path of a bullet when an attacker points a gun at
him.

<P>
Of course, the defender may decline to dodge, but shoot back instead. In
this case, the action is Unopposed-- making the Difficulty Level is all
that is needed to hit. The GM may make such actions simultaneous.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Example: Nevada Slim and the El Paso Hombre are facing off in a
showdown. Both are in the open, in the sunlight, so there's no lighting
or cover difficulty. The range is obviously the same for both-- the GM
rules it's a Fair task to hit each other. Slim rolls a Poor result, and
the Hombre a Mediocre result. The Hombre's bullet came closer to Nevada
Slim than vice versa, but both missed since neither made the Difficulty
Level.
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Another Example: Will Scarlet is shooting a longbow from the greenwood
at Dicken, the Sheriff's man, who has a crossbow. Dicken knows Will is
there, because the man next to him just keeled over with an arrow
through his chest. Dicken is in the open, in good light, so only range
is of any concern to Will Scarlet: the GM says even a Mediocre shot will
hit since they are fairly close. The range for Dicken to hit Will is of
course the same, but Will is partially hidden behind a log (cover), and
just inside the foliage, so the lighting makes it hard to see him
clearly. The GM decrees Dicken needs a Good roll to hit Will. Dicken
rolls a Fair result, missing Will. Will rolls a Mediocre result, which
hits Dicken, even though it wasn't as good a shot as Dicken's.

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In both examples, the fighters forfeited their Dodges in order to shoot
simultaneously. Each combatant needed to make the appropriate Difficulty
Level to hit. Under these conditions, it's possible for both combatants
to succeed in the same combat round. Had Dicken's shot hit, Will and
Dicken would have skewered each other.

<P>
Guns and similar weapons that do not rely on muscle power should be
rated for damage at the beginning of the game. No detailed list is
provided, but as a rough guideline: The average small hand gun might be
of +2 to +3 Strength, while a derringer might be +1 or even +0. Powerful
two-handed projectile weapons are at +5 and higher, while bazookas and
other anti-tank weapons are at +10 and higher. Science fiction small
weapons may do as much damage as a modern bazooka-- but some are
designed to capture people without injuring them.

<P>
Automatic weapons can be simulated roughly by allowing more bullets to
hit with higher relative degrees. That is, blasting away with a weapon
that fires 20 bullets in a combat round and hitting with relative degree
+1-- a graze-- means only one or two hit the target. If a relative
degree +8 represents maximum amount of ammunition on target (whatever
that may be for a given weapon), then hitting with a +4 means about half
maximum hit the target, while +2 means only one quarter.

<P>
If there is no effective armor, simply add a big damage number if lots
of bullets hit: this is going to Incapacitate anyone, at the very
least. If armor is at all likely to slow down a bullet, you can't just
add a bigger and bigger damage number if more bullets hit: the armor has
a chance to slow down each bullet. In this case, rather than roll damage
for each bullet, or have them all stopped, the GM needs to fudge some
medium result: give a slight damage bonus if more projectiles hit the
target.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Wounds
</H1> 
<P>
Fudge offers various methods of tracking wounds, with many options. It
is impossible to be 100% accurate when simulating damage to such an
intricate mechanism as a living being. This is true even for detailed
simulations-- for an abstract role-playing game, it is hard to get close
to reality at all.

<P>
Consequently, many GMs don't try to be very accurate, and want a simple
system that works and lets the story flow. Others want as much accuracy
as they can get. Fudge presents a simple freeform system that works, and
suggests some options to make it more mechanical, and encourages each GM
to add as much detail as she is happy with.

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Wound Levels
</H2> 
<P>
Combat damage to a character can be described as being at one of seven
stages of severity. The stages are:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Undamaged:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>no wounds at all. The character is not necessarily
healthy-- he may be sick, for example. But he doesn't have a combat
wound that's recent enough to be bothering him.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Just A Scratch:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>no real game effect, except to create
tension. This may eventually lead to being Hurt if the character is hit
again. This term comes from the famous movie line, ``I'm okay, it's only
a scratch.'' The actual wound itself may be a graze, bruise, cut,
abrasion, etc., and the GM whose game is more serious in tone may choose
to use one of these terms instead.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Hurt:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>the character is wounded significantly, enough to slow him
  down: -1 to all traits which would logically be affected. A Hurt
  result in combat can also be called a Light Wound.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Very Hurt:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>the character is seriously hurt, possibly stumbling:
-2 to all traits which would logically be affected. A Very Hurt result
can also be called a Severe Wound.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Incapacitated:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>the character is so badly wounded as to be
incapable of any actions, except possibly dragging himself a few feet
every now and then or gasping out an important message. A lenient GM can
allow an Incapacitated character to perform such elaborate actions as
opening a door or grabbing a gem....

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Near Death:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>the character is not only unconscious, he'll die in
less than an hour-- maybe a lot less-- without medical help. No one
recovers from Near Death on their own unless very lucky.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Dead:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>he has no more use for his possessions, unless he belongs to a
culture that believes he'll need them in the afterlife....
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The GM may expand or contract these stages. For example, expand Hurt and
Very Hurt to Light Wound, Moderate Wound and Severe Wound. In this case,
a Severe Wound might be -3 to all actions-- or the GM might leave it at
-2, make Moderate Wound = -1, and make Light Wound something in between
a Scratch and Moderate Wound. That is, maybe a Light Wound causes no
penalty during combat (you don't notice such a slight wound in the heat
of battle), but after combat the character will be at -1 to all skills
until it's healed (such wounds can be annoying later).

<P>
The GM may allow a high Difficulty Level Willpower roll to reduce or
even nullify penalties listed at Hurt, Very Hurt, and possibly
Incapacitated. A gift of a High Pain Threshold will reduce the penalties
by one level, while a fault of a Low Pain Threshold will increase
penalties by one.

<P>
Some players delight in describing their characters' wounds in detail,
even writing resulting scars into the character story.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Automatic Death:</SPAN> sometimes you don't have to roll the
dice. Holding a knife to a helpless character's throat is a good
example-- no roll needed to kill such a character, but the killer's
karma suffers.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00952000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:damagecapacity"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Damage Capacity
</H2> 
<P>
In Fudge, Damage Capacity determines how wounds affect a
character. Damage Capacity may be called Hit Points, if desired. It may
be tied to a character trait such as Constitution (or Hardiness,
Fitness, Health, Body, Strength, etc.), or it may be a separate trait--
see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#sec:charexamples">6.3</A>, Character Examples. It can also
be treated as a gift/fault.

<P>
The GM decides how to handle the differing abilities of humans to take
damage. It really does vary, but how much is open to debate.

<P>
As an extreme example, take the death of the Russian monk Rasputin, the
adviser to Czarina Alexandra, in 1916. He was fed enough cyanide to kill
three normal people, but showed no signs of it. He was then shot in the
chest and pronounced dead by a physician. A minute later he opened his
eyes and attacked his assassins! They shot him twice more, including in
the head, and beat him severely with a knuckle-duster. He was again
pronounced dead, tied in curtains and ropes, and tossed into a
river. When his body was retrieved three days later, it was found he had
freed an arm from his bindings before finally dying of drowning!
Clearly, the man could soak up damage well beyond most peoples'
abilities. He is not unique, however: there are many cases in history of
people being hard to kill.

<P>
On the other hand, the phrase ``glass jaw'' is familiar to most English
speakers, referring to those who are hurt from the slightest blow.

<P>
So there is undoubtedly some room for variation in damage capacity in
characters.

<P>
If the GM is handling wounds in a freeform matter, make Damage Capacity
an attribute and let players rate their characters in it like any other
attribute. Or have a gift (Damage Resistant, perhaps) and a fault
(Fragile, maybe), and let everyone without either the gift or the fault
be normal in this regard. The GM can assess the character's ability to
take damage based on that information and the situation at hand.

<P>
If the GM wants a more numerical approach to wound determination, it
requires some forethought. If Damage Capacity is an attribute, the
easiest way to rate it numerically in Fudge is the standard:

<P>
However, since light metal armor, as listed in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:samplewoundfactors">4.54</A>, Sample Wound Factors List, only
grants a +2 to defense against being wounded, it is easily seen that a
Great Damage Capacity is equal to light metal armor. Some GMs will find
this absurd: a naked person of Great Damage Capacity can turn a sword as
well as an armored person of Fair Damage Capacity. Others will remember
Rasputin, and consider it within the bounds of reason-- it could be
part body size (vital organs harder to reach) and part healthiness
(muscle tissue more resistant to being cut).

<P>
For simplicity, any equation-driven approach to wounds in Fudge assumes
the GM will use a Damage Capacity attribute, and it is rated from +3 to
-3, as listed above. If you are not happy with this, please make the
necessary mental substitution.

<P>
Here are some other possible ways to handle Damage Capacity numerically:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Make Damage Capacity an attribute, as above, but instead of
   automatically granting a bonus, require a Damage Capacity die roll
   every time a character is hit for at least a Light Wound (Hurt
   result). On a result of:

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Great or better:</SPAN> reduce the severity of the wound by one.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Mediocre to Good:</SPAN> no adjustment to the severity of the wound.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Poor or worse:</SPAN> increase the severity of the wound by one.

<P>
This adjustment can either be one wound level, or simply one damage
    point, as the GM sees fit.

<P>
For certain types of damage-- perhaps from a stun ray or a quarterstaff
    across the ribs-- the GM can use the values from +3 to -3 without
    requiring a roll.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Do not use a Damage Capacity attribute; instead allow the players to
   take a gift of Damage Resistant (reduces wound severity by one) or a
   fault of Fragile (increases wound severity by one). Again, this
   adjustment can be one wound level, or one damage point.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Use a Damage Capacity attribute, as outlined as the first
   suggestion under Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:recordingwounds">4.57</A>, Recording
   Wounds. Each hit temporarily reduces your Damage Capacity attribute
   one or more levels.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Use a Willpower attribute instead of Damage Capacity. GMs who believe
   that Rasputin was able to overcome so much damage because his will
   was focused on overcoming his enemies may use this method. Grant an
   adjustment to the wound level based on the result of a Willpower die
   roll. This can be temporary-- until the battle is over-- or actually
   have a permanent affect on reducing wound severity.
</LI>
</OL>

</H2> 
<P>
When determining how wounded a character is when hit in combat, take
into consideration all of the following factors:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>The relative degree the attack succeeded by-- the better the hit, the
   greater likelihood of damage. Winning a combat round with a relative
   degree of +1 means you probably hit where the opponent is most
   heavily armored. Scoring a hit with a +3 finds a chink in the armor.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The strength of the blow. For muscle-powered weapons, such as melee
   weapons, unarmed attacks, bows, slings, etc., this is determined by
   the attacker's Strength attribute: stronger folks tend to hit
   harder. The relative Scale modifier is also figured in here. For
   things like guns, beam weapons, etc., it is relative to the nature of
   the weapon: a .38 usually does more damage than a .22. The
   technological level of the weapon can be important.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The deadliness of the attacker's weapon. Big weapons tend to do more
   damage than little weapons; sharp weapons rip tissue more than dull
   ones, but blunt weapons can cause concussive damage through armor
   thick enough to stop a sharp weapon. People trained in Karate tend to
   do more damage than those untrained in any martial art.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The defender's armor. People wearing thicker armor, and more of it,
   tend to get hurt less than those wearing no armor. Armor can be
   finely differentiated, or simply said to be Light, Medium, or Heavy
   armor. Science fiction scenarios will have Extra-Heavy armor, and
   even further levels. Fantasy campaigns may include magic armor that
   offers even greater protection, sometimes specific against certain
   types of damage.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The amount of damage the victim can soak up (Robustness, Damage
   Capacity, or Mass). Big, healthy guys can take more damage before
   collapsing than little, sickly guys. But it's your call if it's a
   big, sickly fighter against a little, healthy fellow.

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Determining Wound Level
</H2> 
<P>
A given blow will cause a certain level of wounding. In the simplest
wound determination system, the GM assesses all of the Wound Factors
(Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:woundfactors">4.53</A>) and announces how bad the wound is. (In
some cases, however, the PCs won't know the precise degree of damage. In
those cases, the GM can simply say, ``You think you wounded her, but
she's still on her feet,'' or, ``You don't notice any effect.'')

<P>
As an example, the GM thinks to herself, ``Okay, the fighter with Good
Strength just scored a Great hit with a broadsword. The loser rolled a
Fair combat roll, has Good Damage Capacity and heavy leather armor. Hmmm--
I'll say the Strength and Damage Capacity cancel each other, while the
sharp sword should be able to penetrate the leather armor if the blow is
good enough. A Great hit against a Fair defense is enough, but not
really massive: I'd say the loser is Hurt.'' This result would then be
announced to the loser of the combat round.

<P>
The GM can also use a Situational roll to help her. Roll the dice behind
a GM screen, and let the result guide you. A roll of -1 to +1 isn't
significant-- no change from what you decided. But a roll of +3 or +4
adds a wound level or two to the damage.

<P>
See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:recordingwounds">4.57</A>, Recording Wounds, for details on
how to keep track of wounds received.

<P>
That system, while simple and satisfying to a certain type of GM,
doesn't do much for those who prefer the system detailed in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:samplewoundfactors">4.54</A>, Sample Wound Factors
List. There's no point in figuring out the offensive and defensive
factors if you don't do something with the numbers.

<P>
One system that uses the offensive and defensive factors requires
finding the total damage factor. This is derived by adding up all the
attacker's offensive factors and then subtracting all the defender's
factors.

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Since Theodora's damage factor is larger, if she hits him, she'll do
more damage to him than he would to her for an equally well-placed blow.

<P>
Once these numbers are determined, jot them down so you don't have to
refigure them each combat round.

<P>
This system requires each character sheet to have a wound record track
which looks like:

</TABLE></DIV>

<P>
The numbers above the wound levels represent the amount of damage needed
in a single blow to inflict the wound listed under the number. For
example, a blow of 3 or 4 points Hurts the character, while a blow of 5
or 6 points inflicts a Very Hurt wound.

<P>
These numbers can be customized by the GM to fit her conception of how
damage affects people. Raising the numbers makes it harder to wound
someone, while lowering them makes combat more deadly.

<P>
Note that there is no number given for Dead. This is left up to the GM,
and deliberately not included to prevent accidental PC death.

<P>
However, you can't simply use the damage factor you determined above--
relative degree is also important.

<P>
A relative degree of +1 is treated as a graze-- see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:grazing">4.56</A>, Grazing.

<P>
Otherwise, simply add the relative degree to the damage factor. (You may
also wish to include a damage roll-- see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:damagedieroll">4.61</A>, Damage Die Roll.)

<P>
The result is a number that may or may not be a positive number. If it's
zero or less, no damage is scored.

<P>
If the number is positive, look up the result across the top of the
wound levels, and figure the wound as described above. If Leroy hits
Theodora with a relative degree of +2, he adds that to his damage
potential of +2 to produce a damage number of 4. Looking down, we see
that a result of 4 is a Hurt result (Light Wound). Theodora is Hurt, and
at -1 until she is healed.

<P>
For more detail, see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:combatandwoundingexample">4.7</A>, Combat
and Wounding Example.

<P>
There are other ways to figure damage. A GM who believes the relative
degree is more important than the damage factor would double it before
adding it to the damage factor. The numbers above the wound levels
should be adjusted in this case:

<P>
This is a satisfying system that is recommended for those who don't mind
doubling relative degree.

<P>
Others feel Strength is more important, and so on. A totally different
wounding system is given in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:minmidmax">4.63</A>, Min-Mid-Max Die
Roll. Many others have been proposed for Fudge over the years, and it
would be easy to import one from another game system. Use what you feel

Any relative degree of +1 can do at most a GM-set Wound level (plus any

A GM may or may not allow a damage die roll on a graze, even if using
the die rolls for other hits. If allowed, a damage roll shouldn't change
the result of a graze by more than one level.

<P>
Scale difference is a little trickier to figure, but it should be
minimized for such a narrow victory: a giant's club could give a human a
glancing blow that might inflict a Very Hurt result, but not necessarily
Incapacitate.

On the other hand, a tiger biting a mouse with a relative degree of +1
grazes the mouse as a cow grazes grass....

</H2> 
<P>
Once the final damage is determined, it is recorded on the wounded
fighter's character sheet. Each individual wound is described as a
Scratch, Hurt (Light Wound), etc., as introduced in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:woundlevels">4.51</A>, Wound Levels.

<P>
Use a Damage Capacity attribute as an easy way to record wounds. (In
this case, Damage Capacity is not figured into determining wound
severity.) Each hit that is greater than a Scratch reduces a character's
Damage Capacity attribute one level-- or more, if the GM deems the hit
to be severe enough. (Scratches can accumulate as the GM desires--
perhaps three Scratches equal one hit.)

<P>
When someone is reduced to Mediocre Damage Capacity, he is Hurt: -1 to
all actions. When he is at Poor Damage Capacity, he is Very Hurt: -2 to
all actions. When he drops to Terrible, he is at -3 to all actions-- or
Incapacitated, if a GM wishes to play it that way. Damage Capacity below
Terrible is Incapacitated, at least-- possibly worse.

<P>
(For characters of Mediocre or worse Damage Capacity, these levels only
affect them when damaged. That is, an undamaged character of Mediocre
Damage Capacity is not at -1 to all actions. However, if he takes even
one hit, he drops to Poor Damage Capacity, and is at -2 to all actions.)

<P>
Healing in such a system cannot raise Damage Capacity above a
character's undamaged level-- that can only be raised through Character
Development (see Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node10.html#chap:chardevel">5</A>).

This character is still at -2 to all skills. The Hurt result is not
cumulative with the Very Hurt result; only the penalty for the highest
recorded wound level counts.

<P>
If there is no open box for a given wound result, the character takes
the next highest wound for which there is an open box. If the character
above, for example, takes another Hurt result, we see that there is no
open box in either Hurt or Very Hurt, so we have to go to Incapacitated:
the character is now incapacitated, and the sheet would look like:

<P>
Note that an ``H'' is recorded under the Incapacitated label. The
character is indeed Incapacitated-- he can't fight any more-- but for
healing (and scarring) purposes, he has only received two Hurt wounds
and one Very Hurt wound-- never an Incapacitating wound in one
blow. Since Incapacitating blows are harder to heal from, this is
important.

<P>
As another example, a character that takes two Very Hurt results without
taking any other hits is Incapacitated, since that is the next highest
wound level.

<P>
Note that three boxes are provided under Scratch. This can be customized
by each GM, of course. A Scratch wound will not make a fighter Hurt
until he receives his fourth Scratch. Optionally, a Scratch will never
raise a character's wound level beyond Very Hurt, no matter how many he
takes. The GM should not to use this rule when the PCs fight a monster
of huge Scale. Otherwise, they'd never be able to kill such a creature
when the worst wound they can inflict is a Scratch.

<P>
The wound progression above makes for a fairly realistic campaign. For a
more cinematic campaign (especially those without magic or science
fiction healing), add an extra box for Scratch, Hurt, and possibly Very
Hurt: lesser blows won't accumulate so quickly to hinder the
character. A moderately cinematic character sheet looks like:

<P>
It wouldn't be out of line, for an epic scale game, to add up to two
more boxes to Hurt and Very Hurt.

<P>
Be warned that adding boxes can lengthen combat significantly.

<P>
Never add boxes for cannon-fodder NPCs, though you may wish to do so for
major NPCs. In fact, NPC pawns don't even need the system above. A
simple three-stage system of Undamaged, Hurt, Out of the Battle is good
enough for most of them. Simply make a mark under an NPC's name for
Hurt, and cross out the name for Out of the Battle.

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN> Non-human Scale in Combat
</H2> 
<P>
The attacker's Strength Scale is added to his offensive damage factors,
and the defender's Mass Scale is added to her defensive damage
factors. If you have combat with beings weaker than humans, remember
what you learned in school about adding and subtracting negative
numbers....

<P>
Armor and weapons affect the damage done normally, since they are scaled
to the folks using them. Hits become Scratches, Hurt, etc., as usual--
see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:determiningwoundlevel">4.55</A>, Determining Wound Level.

<P>
However, an extremely small character is not likely to be able to wound
a large one in the numerical value wounding system. The GM may allow a
point or two of damage to penetrate if the small character gets a
critical success. Poison-tipped arrows and lances are also a
possibility: the small character can aim for joints in the armor and
merely has to break the skin to inject the poison.

<P>
Also, this system treats Mass Scale like armor, which isn't quite
accurate. In reality, a small opponent may be slowly carving the larger
fighter up, but each wound is too petty, relative to the large scale, to
do much damage by itself. To reflect a lot of small wounds gradually
inflicting a hit on a large-scale foe, allow a damage roll when Scale
prevents a hit from doing any damage-- that is, when Scale is the only
difference between getting a Scratch and no damage at all. See Section
4.61, Damage Die Roll.

<P>
There are also ``scale piercing'' weapons, such as whale harpoons and
elephant guns. These don't have massive damage numbers: instead, if they
hit well, simply halve the Scale value, or ignore it all together. Of
course, if such a weapon is used on a human, it would indeed have a
massive damage modifier....

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Combat Examples:</SPAN> In the following examples, each fighter's Strength
Scale equals his own Mass Scale, but not his opponent's. (E.g., Wilbur's
Strength is Scale 0 and his Mass is Scale 0.) Also, it is assumed the GM
is not using the optional damage roll, which could vary damage in all
three combats discussed.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN> Wound Options
</H1> 
<P>
This section introduces some of the simpler options for determining
wounds. Many others are possible in Fudge, and this list should not be
considered official or exhaustive. They are included for possible use,
but also to inspire the GM to create her own.

<P>

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Damage Die Roll
</H2> 
<P>
Although the damage roll is optional, it is recommended if you are using
numerical damage factors. This is because the damage factors are
generally fixed for the entire fight, and things tend to get
stagnant. It also allows a tiny fighter to have a chance against a
larger foe-- a satisfying result.

<P>
There are many possible ways to use a damage die roll.

<P>
One could roll a single Fudge die for a result of -1, 0, or +1. This can
be added to the damage factor, or, more broadly, to the actual wound
level.

<P>
For example, if a fighter inflicts 4 points of damage, that is normally
a Hurt result. If a +1 on 1dF is rolled, however, that can make the
result +5 (if adding to the damage factor), which brings it up to Very
Hurt result. However, a -1 wouldn't change the wound: it would lower the
result to 3, which is still a Hurt result. But if the GM is using 1dF to
alter the wound level, then a -1 changes the result to a Scratch, since
that's one wound level below Hurt.

<P>
Instead of a separate damage roll, one could simply use the die rolls
used to resolve the Opposed action. If the attacker wins with an even
roll (-4, -2, 0, +2, +4), add one to his offensive factor. If he wins
with an odd result (-3, -1, +1, +3), his offensive factor is
unchanged. Do the same for the defender, except it affects his defensive
factor. This system will help the defender 2525time.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Example: the defender loses the combat round, but rolls his trait level
exactly (die roll of 0): he adds one to his defensive damage factor. The
attacker wins with a die roll of +3: his offensive damage factor is
unchanged. The final damage number is reduced by one-- the defender,
although losing the round, managed to dodge left as the attacker thrust
a bit to the right, perhaps. He may still be wounded, but he got his
vital organs out of the way of the blow.

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This system could also be applied to the wound level instead of the
damage factor.

<P>
A more complicated system uses a Situational roll (result from -4 to +4,
not based on any trait), and adds it to the calculated damage number
(the number over the wound level), as found in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:determiningwoundlevel">4.55</A>, Determining Wound
Level. Negative final damage is treated as zero damage.

<P>
The GM may wish to apply some limitations to the damage roll, to
restrict too wild a result. For example:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>If the calculated damage is positive, the damage roll cannot exceed
   the calculated damage. That is, if the calculated damage is +2, any
   damage roll of +3 or +4 is treated as +2, for a total of 4 points of
   damage.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If the calculated damage is positive, the final damage cannot be less
   than +1.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If the calculated damage is negative or zero, the final damage may be
   raised to a maximum of +1 by a damage roll.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">First Example:</SPAN> The calculated damage is found to be -2
due to armor and Scale. It would take a +3 or +4 die roll to inflict a
wound on the defender in this case, and then only 1 point of calculated
damage: a Scratch.
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Second Example:</SPAN> The calculated damage is +2 (a Scratch). A damage roll
of +2 to +4 results in final damage of four points, since calculated
damage cannot be more than doubled by a damage roll. A damage roll of +1
results in final damage of three points, while a damage roll of 0
results in two points of final damage. Any negative die roll results in
one point of final damage, since a positive calculated damage cannot be
reduced below one by a damage roll.

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
For simplicity, of course, the GM can simply ignore the limitations, and
allow the damage roll to be anywhere from -4 to +4, let the chips fall
where they may....

<P>
Many other damage die rolls are possible-- these are only given as
examples to the GM.

<A NAME="sec:stun"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Stun, Knockout, and Pulling Punches
</H2> 
<P>
A player can announce that his character is trying to stun or knock his
opponent out rather than damage her. Using the flat of a blade instead
of the edge, for example, can accomplish this. Damage is figured
normally, but any damage inflicted doesn't wound the opponent: it stuns
her instead.

<P>
In this case, a Hurt result is called a ``Stun''-- a stunned character
cannot attack or all-out defend, and is at -1 to defend for one combat
turn only. However, the Stun result stays on the character sheet: that
is, a second Stun result, even if delivered more than one combat round
after the first, will cause the character to become Very Stunned. (Stun
results heal like Scratches: after combat is over.)

<P>
A Very Hurt result in a stunning attack is called a Very Stunned result
instead: no attacks and -2 to all actions for two combat rounds.

<P>
A result of Incapacitated or worse when going for stun damage results in
a knockout. A knocked-out character doesn't need healing to recuperate
to full health-- just time. (Only a harsh GM would roll for the
possibility of brain damage-- this is fiction, not reality.)

<P>
The GM may simply decide that a successful Good blow (or better) to the
head knocks someone out automatically. In an Opposed action, the Good
blow would also have to win the combat, of course.

<P>
Likewise, a player may choose to have his character do reduced damage in
any given attack. This is known as ``pulling your punch,'' even if you are
using a sword. This commonly occurs in duels of honor, where it is only
necessary to draw ``first blood'' to win, and killing your opponent can
get you charged with murder. A Scratch will win a ``first blood'' duel--
it is not necessary to Hurt someone.

<P>
To pull your punch, simply announce the maximum wound level you will do
if you are successful. A fencer can say he is going for a Scratch, for
example. In this case, even if he wins the Opposed action by +8, and
adds in +3 for his sword, the worst he can do is nick his foe. He was
just trying for a Scratch-- but the Scratch is probably in the shape of
the letter ``Z'' with such a result!

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Min-Mid-Max Die Roll
</H2> 
<P>
This system of wound determination does not pretend to be a realistic
method, and can produce some wildly varying results. But it's quick,
easy, and lots of fun, and so works well in a certain style of gaming.

<P>
This system requires 3d6 for a damage roll, even if using 4dF for action
resolution.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Overview:</SPAN> roll 3d6 when a damage roll is called for. You will probably
only read one of the dice, however: either the lowest value (Min),
median value (Mid) or highest value (Max), depending on damage factor
and relative degree. The greater the damage factor and/or relative
degree, the greater the d6 you read for result.

<P>
If using the Min-Mid-Max system, use the wound track on the character
sheet listed in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:recordingwounds">4.57</A>, Recording Wounds:

<P>
The offensive and defensive damage factors listed in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:samplewoundfactors">4.54</A>, Sample Wound Factors List, are
used.  However, they are not added to the relative degree. Instead,
simply derive the total damage factor as normal: (attacker's Strength +
Scale + weapon) minus (defender's Damage Capacity + Scale + armor). Each
player should jot down this number once it is known for the combat.

<P>
Before the game begins, the GM decides how important the damage factor
and relative degree are in determining wound severity. The following
table is recommended as a starting point; the GM can adjust it as she
sees fit:

</TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
A damage factor of 3, for example, has a die-reading bonus of +1, while
a relative degree of 3 has a die-reading bonus of 0. The GM may charge a
-2 penalty if the damage factor is well below zero (-5 or worse).

<P>
Since the graze rules are used unchanged with this system, there is no
listing for relative degree less than 2.

<P>
Add the bonus for damage factor with the bonus for relative degree to
get a final bonus. Example: a character has a damage factor of +3
(bonus: +1) and a relative degree of +5 (bonus: +1).  His total bonus
for that round of combat is +2.

<P>
What do these bonuses represent?

<P>
A total ``bonus'' of less than zero means no damage is possible-- don't
even roll the dice. Otherwise, locate the total bonus on the following
table:

<P>

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Min = lowest die.
</LI>
<LI>Mid = median die.
</LI>
<LI>Max = highest die.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The median is the value in the middle. This may be the same as the
highest or lowest, as in a roll of 2, 4, 4: the Min = 2, the Mid = 4,
and the Max = 4. A roll of triples means Min = Mid = Max. (Please read
the median value-- not necessarily the die that is physically between
the other two on the table.)

<P>
Once you have determined which die to read, compare it with the numbers
above the wound levels. With a roll of 1, 3, 5, for example, the Min die
= 1 (a Scratch result), the Mid die = 3 (a Hurt result), and the Max die
= 5 (a Very Hurt result). You would only read one of these results,
however-- not all three.

<P>
With three or more bonuses, add the appropriate dice as listed on the
table. For results beyond 9, the GM is free to kill the recipient
outright, or merely keep it as a Near Death result, as called for by the
situation.

<P>
The tables are not meant to be intrusive, merely guidelines. The basic
intent is to read the Mid if the attacker has either a decent damage
factor or a decent relative degree; to read the Min if he has neither;
and to read the Max if he has both. All other values are derived from
that simple idea. So the GM can ignore all the tables, and with that
idea in mind, just fudge which die to read.

<P>
For example, a GM might say, ``Whoa! You just hit him across the forehead
as he backed into a bucket left by the hastily fleeing janitor. Nice
shot-- he topples over onto his back. For damage, roll 3d6 and read the
Max!''

<P>
This would have come out of a descriptive game, in which the players
describe their characters' actions in great detail.

a +1 to the die-reading bonus.) The GM rolls a 1, 4, 6. She reads the
Max and adds 1 for a total of 7. Reading the wound table on the
character sheet, she sees that this is Incapacitated, and declares that
Rachel's staff just smashed across the bridge of Archie's nose, probably
doing serious damage, and at least knocking him out of this battle....

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> PC Death
</H2> 
<P>
Sometimes the dice try to kill a PC. In most campaigns, PC death
shouldn't occur through a bad die roll, but only if the character's
actions were truly self-sacrificing-- or stupid-- enough to warrant
death. Three methods of preventing accidental PC death are
presented. They may be used separately or together or not at all.

<P>
These should not be used for run-of-the-mill NPCs, but could be used for
major ones.

<P>
The ``automatic death'' rule in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:woundlevels">4.51</A>, Wound
Levels, takes precedence over these suggestions.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>A character cannot take more than three levels of wounds in one
   blow. For example, an unwounded character could be Scratched, Hurt,
   or Very Hurt in one blow, but any excess damage points beyond that
   would be lost. A Hurt character could go all the way to Near Death in
   one blow, but not be killed outright.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A character cannot be rendered Near Death unless he began that combat
   round Incapacitated. This is simpler to keep track of than the first
   system, and assumes there is some great difference between a severe
   wound and mortal wound. There probably isn't, but the rule isn't
   intended to be realistic: it's to make the PCs more heroic than real
   life.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A player may spend a Fudge Point (Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node6.html#sec:fudgepoints">1.36</A>)
   to convert a deadly wound to a merely serious one.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Technological Levels as Scale
</H2> 
<P>
Technological differences between weapons and armor can be expressed as
Scale if the GM desires. Instead of figuring exactly how much
mega-damage a transvibrational subneural pulverizer does, the GM can
simply say, ``This is a weapon that is of the same technological level as
the armor of the defender-- therefore, it has the same effect on her as
a modern pistol would on kevlar.''  However, if used against someone who
is wearing kevlar, the transvibrational subneural pulverizer does lots
and lots of damage-- kevlar wasn't designed to stop this type of thing.

<P>
Basically, there isn't much difference between thrusting a sword through
a naked man's kidney, or shooting him with a .38 through the kidney, or
using a transvibrational subneural pulverizer on the kidney: naked
people don't resist most weapons well. Plate armor stops the sword well,
but won't slow down the .38 enough to help much-- unless it can deflect
it away from the kidney, that is. It probably won't help at all against
the pulverizer, but it may: the GM will have to decide the effect of
such a weapon on plate armor.

<P>
The concept of technological levels as Scale only comes into effect when
weapons of one technological era are used against armor of another
technological era. At that point, the GM can add an arbitrary Scale
difference to the weapon-- or armor, whichever is of the higher tech
level. No attempt to quantify tech levels is made here. This section is
merely food for thought.

Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:samplewoundfactors">4.54</A>, Sample Wound Factors List. It also
uses a damage die roll: the 4dF option, with the three limitations
listed.

<P>
The two opponents are Medieval warriors, Snorri and Brynhild. The fight
takes place in a barroom, which quickly empties of other occupants once
weapons are drawn. No one noticed that the innkeeper's son had actually
left much earlier than this, when the belligerent Snorri was merely
exchanging insults with the proud Brynhild. Both fighters are human
(Scale 0), so Scale is left out of the discussion.

<P>
Snorri's skill is reduced to Good for this combat by Brynhild's shield--
see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:meleemodifiers">4.31</A>, Melee Modifiers.

<P>
In the first round, Snorri gets a Great result on his weapon skill (die
roll = +1), and Brynhild gets a Fair result (die roll = -1). Snorri wins
with a relative degree of +2. Snorri's damage factor of +3 is added in,
bringing the damage to +5. Looking at the character sheet, a +5 result
equals a Very Hurt wound-- before rolling for damage.

<P>
The GM is requiring damage rolls, so Snorri's player rolls the dice: a
-2 result, too bad. This brings the damage down to 3. Since Brynhild is
an NPC, the GM looks at the wound chart on her character sheet, and
finds 3: a Hurt Wound. The GM marks off the box under the word ``Hurt,''
and the next round is fought. Brynhild is now at -1 for the rest of the
combat.

<P>
In the second round, both combatants get Good results-- a standoff. The
GM describes it as a give-and-take of blows that are all parried or
blocked as the fighters circle each other. Another five seconds have
passed this round, the GM decrees.

<P>
In the third round, Snorri gets a Great result and Brynhild only a Good
result-- Snorri has hit again. Since the relative degree is +1, this is
a graze. The GM does allow a damage die roll on a graze, but won't let
it change the result by more than one level. Snorri's damage factor of
+3 normally means a Scratch on a graze.

<P>
Snorri rolls a 0 for damage, so the GM marks off a Scratch box on
Brynhild's character sheet.

<P>
In the fourth round, Snorri decides to finish off the Hurt Brynhild in
one blow: he all-out attacks, which gives him a +1 modifier to his
skill, and a +1 to damage if he wins. Brynhild had decided to try for a
situational advantage, though: she's spending this round in all-out
defense, hoping to spot some way to get an advantage over Snorri for the
fifth round. Brynhild gets a +2 modifier to her skill this turn, but
can't hurt Snorri if she wins. Snorri gets a Great result, even counting
his +1 for all-out attacking, and Brynhild also gets a Great
result. Snorri would ordinarily have lost the combat round (all-out
attackers lose tie results), but Brynhild's all-out defense means she
doesn't aim any blows at Snorri, just beats his attack down.

<P>
The GM requires a Good Perception roll from Brynhild in order to spot a
situational advantage. Her Perception attribute is Great, so she easily
makes it. She notices a drink on the floor, spilled earlier by a
customer in full flight. Since she successfully defended that round, the
GM rules she maneuvers Snorri into the slippery puddle for one round.

<P>
In the fifth round, the GM gives Snorri a -1 to skill this round (down
to Fair) for bad footing. Snorri tries an ordinary attack, and Brynhild,
wounded, desperate, and sensing this may be her only chance, now tries
an all-out attack: +1 modifier to her skill, bringing her up to an
effective skill of Good from her wounded Fair state. Brynhild rolls a
Great result, and Snorri only gets a Good result: Brynhild wins this
round by +1.

<P>
Since she was doing an all-out attack, she gets a bonus of +1 to
damage. This does affect a graze, so her normal Scratch result (for a
graze) is increased to Hurt. She rolls a 0 on the damage roll, so Snorri
is now Hurt: -1 until healed.

<P>
The combat is interrupted at this point by the town guards, who had been
alerted by the innkeeper's son. Snorri and Brynhild are hauled off to
separate cells, probably only too glad to get out of what had become a
potentially deadly duel....

<P>

<A NAME="sec:healing"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN> Healing
</H1> 
<P>
Wounds are healed through a medical skill or supernormal power.

<P>
A Scratch is too insignificant to require a roll on a healing skill
(although it might require a kiss to make it better...). Scratches are
usually erased after a battle, provided the characters have five or ten
minutes to attend to them. An individual GM may rule otherwise, of
course: they may linger on for a day or two.

<P>
A Good result on a healing skill heals all wounds one level (Hurt to
healed, Very Hurt to Hurt, etc.). (Scratches do not count as a level for
healing purposes. That is, a Hurt wound that is healed one level is
fully healed.) A Great result heals all wounds two levels, and a Superb
result heals three levels.

<P>
Healing with realistic medical skills takes time: the success of the
roll merely insures the wounds will heal, given enough rest. How long
this takes depends on the technological level of the game setting, and
is up to the GM. (A day per treated wound is extremely fast healing, but
may be appropriate in an epic-style game. Likewise, one minute per
magically healed wound is fast.) Whether or not strenuous activity
before the healing period ends reopens a wound is also left up to the
GM....

<P>
Example: a character with three wounds (two Hurt results and one Very
Hurt) is healed with a roll of Good. After the appropriate time, the two
Hurt wounds will be fully healed, while the Very Hurt wound will now be
a Hurt wound (and carries a -1 modifier as such).

<P>
Otherwise, wounds heal on their own at one wound level per week of
rest-- or longer, if the GM is being more realistic. That is, after a
week of rest, an Incapacitated character becomes Very Hurt, etc. The GM
may also require a successful roll against a Constitution attribute:
Fair Difficulty Level for Hurt, Good Difficulty Level for Very Hurt, and
Great Difficulty Level for Incapacitated. Failing this roll slows the
healing process. Someone Near Death should take a long time to heal,
even with magical or high tech healing.
