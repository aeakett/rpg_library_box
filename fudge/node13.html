<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">A Sample Implementation of Fudge by Ann Dupuis</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Based on ``Five Point Fudge'' by Steffan O'Sullivan</SPAN>

<P>
Five-point Fudge is an alternative character creation system by Steffan
O'Sullivan. It's used here as a basis for a sample Fudge fantasy
role-playing game.

<P>
Five-point Fudge is suitable for any genre, but each genre requires
customized skill lists, gifts, faults, and attributes. The version
presented here is for a Fantasy genre only. These lists should not be
considered as canon-- everything in Fudge is fully customizable, and
these lists are offered only as an easy introduction to Fudge.

<P>
Fudge itself makes no mention of ``character points,'' using the word
``levels'' instead.  The Five Point Fudge system of character creation
introduces character creation points, which are different from levels.

<P>
Fantasy Fudge is an example of one way a Gamemaster may decide to
customize Fudge to a fantasy campaign world. The game design choices
made in Fantasy Fudge shouldn't be considered the ``best'' way to play
Fudge in a fantasy game, as players' and GMs' tastes vary.

</H1>

<P>
Fantasy Fudge uses the standard seven-level Trait scale to describe a
character's attributes and skills (see Fudge in a Nutshell, above.) To
create a character, follow these steps:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Decide what type of character you would like to create. If you're
   not sure, see the Broad Class Templates,
   section&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#sec:broadclasstemplates">6.42</A> of the core Fudge rules, for
   some ideas. See also Character Creation Tips, section .

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Spend ``points'' to purchase skills from two or more Skill Groups. See
   Character Points, right.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Assign Attributes (see Attributes, below).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Choose Gifts (two, unless trading; see Gifts, below).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Choose Faults (two, unless trading; see Faults, below).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Adjust attributes, gifts, faults, or skills by trading if desired.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
You may use the sample Fudge character sheet in the Miscellaneous Charts
and Information at the end of this document to record your character's
traits. With the Skills list, you should record the number of points you
spend in which skill groups (see right). For example:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Combat: 2 pts 
<BR>
Scouting: 2 pts 
<BR>
Athletic: 1 pt

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<A NAME="sec:ffcharacterpoints"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Character Points
</H2>

<P>
The Five Point Fudge system of character creation organizes skills into
skill ``groups'' to help players decide which skills are best for the
characters they wish to create. There are eight skill groups in Fantasy
Fudge: Athletic; Combat; Covert; Knowledge; Magic; Professional;
Scouting; and Social (see below).

<P>
Fantasy Fudge recommends that players be granted 5 points to purchase
skills from these various skill groups. If you wish beginning characters
to be more or less powerful than those presented here, please see
Campaign Power Levels in the full version of Five Point Fudge, online at
<A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="http://www.io.com/~sos/rpg/fudfive.html"><TT>http://www.io.com/~
sos/rpg/fudfive.html</TT></A>.

<P>
A player can spend his points in any of the groups that he chooses, up
to four points in any one group. (He must spend points in at least two
groups.) Each quantity of points spent provides a certain number of
skills (of the player's choice) from the appropriate group, at the
levels shown below.

<P>
Because a character with too few skills may be weak in a given campaign,
the GM may limit the number of points you can spend on narrowly focused
skill groups. (Suggested limit: two points, either 1 in each of 2 Groups
or 2 ``narrow focus'' points in a single Skill Group.)

Examples of point expenditure: if a player wishes his character to be a
dabbler at Combat, he could spend one point on the Combat group. Using a
broad focus, he could then choose any three Combat skills at Fair and
any one at Mediocre. Using a narrow focus, he may choose any two Combat
skills: one at Good and one at Mediocre.

The more points a player spends in a given skill group, the more his
character gains both familiarity with a number of skills and greater
expertise in some of those skills. For example, a Combat specialist is a
professional soldier who will be an expert with a few weapons, but will
have also used many other weapons over the course of his career.

</H3>

<P>
The player may choose any skills within a given skill group, up to the
number listed for the points spent. The player may decide which of those
skills are at the listed levels. If the GM doesn't want a character to
know a given skill, she should make sure the player understands this
before character creation.

<P>
Thus there are thousands of player character types available in this
system, yet all are easily customized to the player's desires. If you
want your character to be a Jack of All Trades, don't spend more than
two points in any skill group. If you want a specialist, spend at least
three points in a skill group.

<P>
The possible combinations of spending five points are:

</H3>

<P>
A player may spend a maximum of one point as a General Skills
point. This means you may spend one point and take any* three skills at
Fair. These skills can be from two or three different skill groups, if
desired (there is no point in taking them all from the same group). Note
that a General Skills point does not get you as many skills as a broadly
focused point (four), but more than a narrowly focused point (two).

<P>
* = The GM may restrict certain skills, such as Magic skills, from being
  taken with a General Skills point.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Trading Skills
</H3>

<P>
During character creation you may trade one skill for two skills of
lesser value. Thus you could trade one Good skill for two Fair skills,
or one Great skill for two Good skills. For example, spending two points
in a skill group normally gets you 2 Good and 4 Fair skills. You could
instead choose 2 Good, 3 Fair, and 2 Mediocre skills.

<P>
Skills involved in the trade must all be from the same skill
group. Exception: with a General Skills point (see above), you can trade
a Fair for two Mediocre skills from two different groups. Thus a
character could take six Mediocre skills from six different groups with
a General Skills point.

<P>
No other trading of skill levels is allowed, unless using the expanded
trading option in Campaign Power Levels (see the full version of
Five-point Fudge online).

</H3>

<P>
The Gamemaster may customize skill points and character creation as
desired. If narrowly focused points seem too costly (giving up half the
skills of a broadly focused point for an increase of one level in one
skill), add another skill at Fair. Do skill levels seem too low for your
epic campaign? After they've created their characters, let your players
raise five skills of their choosing one level each (subject to your
approval).

<P>
See Campaign Power Levels in the full version of Five-point Fudge online
for more tips on customizing character creation.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN> Character Creation Tips
</H3>

<P>
There are many ways to create a character. If you have a concept in
mind, scan the skill lists that seem most likely to fit your
character. A fighter will obviously need to spend some points in Combat
skills, and a thief in Covert skills.

<P>
Since you must spend points in at least two skill groups, try to think
of what other skills would be helpful-- or perhaps simply fun-- for your
character to have.

<P>
Once you've decided which skill groups to choose from, jot down the most
appealing skills in these groups. The number of skills you want from a
given group will tell you how many points you need to spend in that
skill group. For example, if only two or three skills appeal to you from
a group, spending 1 or 2 narrowly focused points is sufficient. If you
really want eight or ten skills all from the same group, you're creating
a specialist character: you'll probably have to spend three or four
points in that skill group to get that many skills. (Another way to get
eight or ten skills, if you don't mind low skill levels, is to use the
``trading skills'' option.) A Jack of All Trades character rarely spends
more than two points in any one group, and is interested in skills from
three or more different skill groups.

<P>
Once your skills are chosen, you can then set your attributes, Gifts,
and Faults. At that point you'll easily be able to see what levels your
attributes should logically be, and which Gifts and Faults would go most
appropriately with your character.

<P>
It's best to consult with the Gamemaster and the other players when
creating characters. This can prevent problems with characters that are
unsuited for the planned campaign, or PCs that encroach on one another's
``spotlight'' time because their skills and abilities compete with rather
than complement those of the other characters. The Gamemaster should
approve all characters before play begins.

Each genre has its own skill groups. Listed here are eight skill groups
for a Fantasy setting. The GM may customize these lists, of course, and
may even add or delete an entire skill group if desired.

Following the lists is an alphabetical list of the skills, with
descriptions and which skill group they appear in.

Note: although four of the skill groups have multiple titles, such as
Athletic/Manual Dexterity Skills, for simplicity they are referred to
outside this list by the first part of the title, such as Athletic
Skills.

Skills marked with an asterisk (*) appear in more than one skill
group. These may be learned by spending points in either skill group--
there is no reason to learn the same skill from two different groups.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Attributes
</H2>

<P>
There are six attributes in Fantasy Fudge. The GM may customize this
list as she wishes-- changing the attributes included, adding or
deleting them at will.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Reasoning:</SPAN> Thinking ability; puzzle-solving; intelligence;
mental acuity.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Perception:</SPAN> Awareness of the environment; raw ability to notice
things.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Willpower:</SPAN> Strength of will; psychic stamina; determination; guts.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Strength:</SPAN> Physical strength; lifting/ carrying capacity;
ability to deal damage.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Agility:</SPAN> Physical dexterity; adroitness; native talent for
physical skills.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Health:</SPAN> Fitness; resistance to disease and injury; physical
stamina.

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Allocating Attributes
</H3>

<P>
All attributes start at Fair.  Each character may take two free
attribute levels, either raising one attribute two levels, or two
attributes one level each.  (The GM may allow more or fewer free
attribute levels-- see Campaign Power Levels in the online version of
Five-point Fudge.)

<P>
In addition, players may trade levels-- that is, lower an attribute to
Mediocre in order to raise one other attribute one level, and so on.
Also, subject to GM approval, a character may raise an attribute by
taking an additional Fault, or by foregoing one of the two free Gifts.

<P>
Conversely, a player may forego one of his free two attribute levels in
order to take an extra Gift-- again, subject to GM approval.

<P>
Attributes are not linked to skills in this game.  The player is
encouraged to choose attribute levels which make sense, given his skill
list. For example, three or more points spent between Combat, Scouting
and Athletic skills means that the character would logically be above
average in Strength, Agility, and/or Health. If the player decides not
to raise at least one of these attributes above Fair, he should have a
good story as to why they are abnormally low.

</H3>

<P>
Attributes are used for three things in the game:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>As very broad skills. There will be times in which no particular skill
  listed in the rules is appropriate for the task the character is
  attempting. In these cases, the GM will choose the closest attribute
  and have the player roll versus the attribute.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In certain opposed actions, such as attempting to sneak by a guard
  (Move Quietly skill vs. Perception attribute) or a swindle attempt
  (Con skill vs. Reasoning attribute) or an attempt to strangle someone
  (Strength attribute vs. Health attribute). The GM will think of other
  cases readily.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>As a broad handle on who the character is. A high Reasoning, low
  Strength character has a different flavor from the opposite attribute
  levels.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Each character may have two Gifts from the following list, or other
GM-approved Gift. In addition, for each Fault chosen beyond the first
two, the character may have an additional Gift. The GM may limit the
number Gifts available from this method, as things can get a little out
of hand?.... You may also gain a Gift, with GM approval, by foregoing
one of your free attribute levels.

<P>
Certain Gifts, marked with an asterisk (*), may be lost if
abused. Contacts, Favors Due, and Patron depend on the goodwill of
others, and it's possible to push them too far or too frequently. Good
Reputation can be eroded by inappropriate behavior, and Rank can be lost
if you break the rules of the organization granting the rank.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Magic
</H1>

<P>
There are four types of Magical Abilities in Fantasy Fudge. The GM may
use them all, choose between them, or create her own. The Magical
Abilities are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Innate Magic

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Hedge Magic

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Scholarly Magic

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Clerical Magic
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Innate Magic takes no study-- it's a Gift you're born with. The
Gamemaster may assign this as a racial gift to non-human races (such as
Elves) if she wishes. All members of such a race would have the Magical
Talent: Innate Gift (or a serious Fault if they don't).

<P>
Hedge Magic and Scholarly Magic are learned techniques. Their Talents
are handled differently and are not interchangeable. Not everyone has
the ability to perform these types of magic-- you need the Magical
Talent Gift.

<P>
Clerical Magic is actually performed by a deity through the
character. You need the Divine Favor Gift to use Clerical Magic.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001321000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:ffinnatemagic"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Innate Magic
</H2>

<P>
This type of magic may be appropriate for Faerie races, who have an
inborn talent for magic that has nothing to do with the learned magic of
human magicians. It's also possible to have a human character with
Innate Magic, if the GM permits.

<P>
Each Innate Magical power requires the Gift, Magical Talent:
Innate. Each such Gift provides only one type of Innate Magic, taken
from the list below. The GM may ban some of these talents, or create
others-- ask. Note that some types of Innate Magic have been listed as
separate Gifts, such as Danger Sense, Empathy with Animals, etc.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Dowsing:</SPAN> you can find water in the earth.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Eagle Eyes:</SPAN> you can see things clearly at a great distance.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Fire-Starter:</SPAN> you can create fire, though not control it. That
is, you can cause something flammable to burst into flames (takes three
combat rounds for small items), but can't make fireballs or direct the
fire to spread in a given direction.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Fortune Telling:</SPAN> you can see a possible future, as through a
glass, darkly. This only works on others, and never on events which are
important to you-- your own future is always obscured.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Green Thumb:</SPAN> plants respond extraordinarily well to you, with
increased growth, health, and production.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Healing Hands:</SPAN> you can heal one level of wounds with a
touch. This takes one minute and is fatiguing (see Hedge Magic, below,
for fatigue effects).

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Second Sight:</SPAN> you can see through illusions and ``read'' general
personalities. You can't read minds or know any details of personality,
but you'll know who to trust if you concentrate.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Shapeshifter:</SPAN> you can change into one GM-approved animal or plant
form. It takes three combat rounds to change fully, during which you are
defenseless. [Costs two Gifts]

<P>
You don't need to spend any points on skills to have Innate Magic-- you
only have to buy the Gift. No skill roll is usually required-- the
talent is automatic, although it may take time. Should it ever be an
issue, each talent is known at a Great level.

<P>
You may add to this list any innate magic abilities for non-human races
in your campaign world.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Hedge Magic
</H2>

<P>
Note: Hedge Magic is based on the Hedge Magic system created for
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">GURPS</SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;(R) by S. John Ross. (<SPAN  CLASS="textbf"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">GURPS</SPAN></SPAN> is a
registered trademark of Steve Jackson Games.)

<P>
GURPS Hedge Magic can be found at:

<P>
<A NAME="tex2html14"
  HREF="http://www.io.com/~sjohn/hedge.htm"><TT>http://www.io.com/~
sjohn/hedge.htm</TT></A>
<P>
Hedge Magic is the ``peasant'' version of magic: hedgerow witches and
village wizards concocting herbal potions, creating charms, nullifying
(or, alas, casting) curses, etc.

<P>
You may spend up to four points in the Hedge Magic group, but only as
many points as you have levels of the Magic Talent: Hedge Magic
Gift. That is, if you take only one level of Magic Talent: Hedge Magic
Gift, you may only spend one point on Hedge Magic skills.

<P>
The skill list for Hedge Magic follows, and is treated like any other
skill group. That is, one point spent in Hedge Magic allows you to
choose 3 skills at Fair and 1 at Mediocre, etc. Each skill is a mundane
skill found in other skill groups-- if you learn it in the Hedge Magic
group, there is no need to learn it from another group.

<P>
You may use a mundane skill from this group without applying Hedge
Magic. But if you use Hedge Magic, you can accomplish more than you
could otherwise. Hedge Magic is not flashy magic-- you'll never see
major magical effects from it. It's nonetheless effective in what it
tries to do.

<P>
Hedge Magic is fatiguing, however-- your Health attribute drops one
level, temporarily, for each use. If your Health level falls below
Terrible, you are exhausted and collapse-- treat as the fatigue
equivalent of ``Incapacitated.'' A level of fatigued Health is regained
simply by resting 15 minutes.

<P>
Another possible downside to Hedge Magic is that the results may be
perceived as magical, which, depending on the situation, may get the
caster in trouble.

<P>
The following mundane skills are the only ones which may be enhanced by
Hedge Magic, unless the GM permits otherwise. Those without descriptions
are simply assumed to provide enhanced results.

<P>


<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Animal Handling</SPAN>

<P>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Astrology:</SPAN> fortune telling for other folk-- grants no inkling
of your own future.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Camouflage:</SPAN> if you don't want to be seen, you're very hard to
spot.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Cooking:</SPAN> tasty, nourishing, mildly healing.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Counseling:</SPAN> your sympathetic ear and wise advise can soothe
troubled souls.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Craft:</SPAN> most of the craft skills, such as Pottery, Smithy,
Tailor, etc., allow you to make superior quality items more
quickly. These items are of exceptional quality, but are not really
magic items? or are they?

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Detect Lies</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Farming:</SPAN> a very common use of hedge magic, you can bless or
curse crops: increased yield, faster growth, etc.-- or the opposite.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">First aid:</SPAN> you can stop bleeding with a touch, and enable the
severely injured to survive until appropriate care is available.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Herb Lore:</SPAN> the archetypal hedge magic skill: preparation of
magical concoctions. While not as potent as alchemical elixirs, they are
quicker to make. Common potions include healing, sleep, love, charisma,
strength, endurance, etc.-- ask the GM what's possible. Use Poisons for
harmful potions.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Medicine:</SPAN> expeditious and efficacious healing.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Move Quietly</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Poisons:</SPAN> your poisons are more potent, faster acting, and
harder to detect. Shame on you.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Storytelling:</SPAN> you can enthrall an audience, and even sway their
mood to your purposes.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Tracking</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Veterinarian:</SPAN> expeditious and efficacious healing. For evil hedge
witches, this is also the skill used to sicken animals, a common
complaint in former days.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Weather Sense:</SPAN> you're remarkably accurate.

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Scholarly Magic
</H2>

<P>
Scholarly Magic is the ``upper class'' version of magic: sorcerers in
towers poring over ancient tomes, wizards roaming the world seeking out
spell-crafters and new sources of power, colleges of magicians teaching
apprentices while debating amongst themselves the merits of this spell
or that, etc.

<P>
A sample Scholarly Magic system is presented below. It's a flexible
magic system, with no preset spell list, and thus leaves a lot of
decisions up to the GM. Gamemasters are welcome to substitute any other
magic system of choice. The sourcebook A Magical Medley from Grey Ghost
Games contains a chapter on creating Fudge magic systems, as well as six
sample systems. The Gramarye is particularly recommended; you can also
find it online at
<A NAME="tex2html15"
  HREF="http://fudge.phoenyx.net/gramarye/"><TT>http://fudge.phoenyx.net/gramarye/</TT></A>. Also
recommended: Fudge Magic (see section&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#sec:fudgemagic">7.1</A> of the core
Fudge rules), GURPS&nbsp;(R) Magic, and Four-by-Five Magic
(<A NAME="tex2html16"
  HREF="http://www.io.com/~sos/rpg/4by5.html"><TT>http://www.io.com/&nbsp;sos/rpg/4by5.html</TT></A>).

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Magical Talent: Scholarly Magic</A>
</H3>

<P>
Characters wishing to learn Scholarly Magic must have the Magical
Talent: Scholarly Magic Gift. You may spend up to four points in the
Scholarly Magic group, but only as many points as you have levels of the
Magic Talent: Scholarly Magic Gift. If you spend only one Gift on Magic
Talent: Scholarly Magic, you may only spend one point on Scholarly Magic
skills. Note that Scholarly Magic skills cost more; see below.

<P>
Characters without Magical Talent may learn the Thaumatology Knowledge
Skill instead. This will allow them to recognize magic spells, skills,
and possibly magic items and talismans (especially if powerful or well
known), but not cast magic themselves.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION001323200000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Skill Points and the Scholarly Magic Skill Group</A>
</H3>

<P>
The Scholarly Magic skills are difficult areas of study, covering
magical incantations, rituals, arcane knowledge, and more. There is no
default for these skills, so a character learning Scholarly Magic
in-game (as opposed to pre-game character creation) would learn the
skill at Terrible. They cost more at character creation, as well.

<P>
Note that you may trade 1 Scholarly Magic skill for 2 skills at one
level lower. And remember that you can spend only as many points in
Scholarly Magic as you have Gifts in Magical Talent: Scholarly Magic.

<P>
The Gamemaster should decide which of the Scholarly Magic skills
presented here are allowed. The ``Black Arts'' (Sorcery and Necromancy)
may be restricted to NPC villains, for example. Likewise, the Scholarly
Magic Skill of Alchemy may be off limits. (PCs should be allowed to take
the Knowledge Skill version of Alchemy, which allows them to recognize
various alchemical potions and know something about the procedures and
ingredients involved in making them, but not actually create magical
elixirs.)

<P>
The GM may also decide that each culture in the game world knows only a
few of the many ``flavors'' of Scholarly Magic. For example, Shamanism may
be restricted to the ``primitive'' tribes on the jungle continent, or to
the horse nomads on the great steppes. Another culture may know
Mesmerism, but outlaw its use. A centuries-old university of mages may
combine Conjuration and Kineticism into a single branch of study, and
likewise with Extra Sensory Perception and Mesmerism. Perhaps Runes are
a lost art, and no one living now understands the strange markings found
on ancient obelisks and monuments and over archways leading to
catacombs.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Scholarly Magic Skills
</H3>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Alchemy:</SPAN> The art of mixing balms, draughts, elixirs, nostrums,
ointments, philters, potions, powders, salves, tinctures, tonics, and
more, with varying magical effects. Non-mages can have knowledge of the
processes and ingredients and final products of alchemy, but are not
able to create magical substances themselves; see the Alchemy
(Knowledge) skill.

<P>
Magical Feats: The GM can have elixirs in the game which produce any
magical effect she wants. Alchemical mixtures are used up when applied;
unless provided in multiple ``doses,'' they only work once.

<P>
In-Game Requirements: Alchemical processes take a lot of time and
materials to prepare. A fully equipped alchemical lab requires great
wealth, which means either a high status or a patron to support
them. Each alchemical concoction takes weeks or months to prepare, with
a high rate of failure, and rare materials that render mass-production
impractical. Player character alchemists are not likely to prepare many
alchemical substances, simply because of the time and effort involved.

<P>
Restrictions: The Gamemaster may require an alchemist to also have a
Magic or Knowledge Skill appropriate to the alchemical effect
desired. For example, a potion of healing may require skill in Herb
Lore, Medicine, or First Aid-- or the equivalent Hedge Magic skills,
hence requiring a Magical Talent: Hedge Magic Gift as well. A philter of
flying may require Kineticism (see below) or collaboration with a
Kineticist.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Artificing:</SPAN> Bestowing magical properties on items.

<P>
Magical Feats: As with alchemy, the GM may allow any enchanted items she
wishes in the game. There are three categories of magic items: charms
and talismans, with long-lasting but subtle magic; ``One-shot'' items such
as scrolls that release their magical effect all at once (some may be
enchanted to work more than once, but will stop working under pre-set
conditions, or after a set number of magical feats are performed); and
permanent magical items, such as magical swords, cloaks of flying, and
the like. ``Magic vessels'' are permanent enchanted items that are
relatively easy to create; they collect and store mana (magical power;
see below) for later use, providing scholarly mages with a ``magic
battery'' of sorts.

<P>
In-Game Requirements: As with alchemy, artificing requires lengthy
rites. Even a simple talisman or charm takes several weeks to ritually
prepare, although actually embuing it with magical power may require
only a short ceremony and a GM-determined expenditure of mana. Powerful,
permanent enchantments require the item to be specifically created and
prepared with the enchantment in mind, and may require the item to be
crafted out of rare or precious materials. It's not enough to take any
old sword and slap an ever-sharp enchantment on it; the sword must be
forged in a prescribed manner, with rituals of artificing and
enchantment performed on it throughout its creation. Artificing also
requires much mana, which is usually expended in several stages
throughout the artificing process.

<P>
Restrictions: Artificing requires the mage to also be skilled in the
type of magic bestowed on the item. A wand that turns the target into a
frog requires the Transmutation skill; a bag of winds requires the
Elemental skill; and so on. Magical scrolls that allow the reader to
cast spells require two skills; the Rune skill (for knowing the symbols
to use to ``write'' the spell on the scroll) and the appropriate magic
type skill (Mesmerism for a sleep spell, etc.). The GM may also require
the artificer to be skilled in crafting the item to be enchanted. Magic
swords may need an Artificer who is also a swordsmith (Smithy
professional skill). If the artificer collaborates with another magician
or with a skilled craftsman in creating an enchanted item, each
participant must match or exceed the Difficulty Level set by the GM at
each stage of the artificing in order for the final enchantment to work.

<P>
Note:The ability to create magic vessels is included in the Artificing
skill, as the ability to store mana in an enchanted item is at the heart
of all artificing.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Conjuration:</SPAN> Creating objects (even creatures!) out of ``thin
air''-- or making objects disappear.

<P>
Magical Feats: A conjurer can produce magical energy (in the form of
heat, or light, or both) or non-magical items (such as water, air, food,
or anything else the GM allows), or creatures (normal animals, magical
creatures, and even sentient creatures). The Gamemaster decides whether
such conjurations actually create these things, or whether they're
``called'' from another dimension or world. Most conjurations have a
limited duration, and will disappear after a GM-set amount of
time. Fairy Gold is an example; it looks and feels and tastes like real
gold, but disappears when the spell has run its course.

<P>
The GM may allow conjurations to be ``renewed'' by expending more
mana. Conjuration may also be used to banish items or creatures,
including creatures and spirits called up by Elementalism, Necromancy,
Shamanism, or Sorcery. Such ``banishments'' are resolved as an Opposed
action-- the Conjuration Skill versus the original skill roll that
called the creatures or items into being.

<P>
In-Game Requirements: Conjurations typically have short casting times
(an hour or less), but require a lot of mana (magical power) to perform.

<P>
Restrictions: Conjuration creates or calls items and creatures-- it
doesn't control them. For a conjurer to have control over his creations,
he'll need Elementalism (to control any element conjured), Kineticism
(to animate items), or Mesmerism (to control conjured creatures).

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Elementalism:</SPAN> Elementalists specialize in controlling and
transforming the four elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.

<P>
Magical Feats: Just about anything involving controlling or transforming
Earth, Air, Fire, or Water can be done with Elementalism. Working with
Earth, one could turn rock to dirt (or vice versa); cause (or calm!) an
earthquake or rockslide; or turn a hard metal brittle. Air magic
includes stirring a gentle breeze into a fiercer wind, or directing it
to carry your words to a particular person's ears in a whisper spell. An
Elementalist's campfire could remain bright and warm without consuming
fuel; or shoot forth a spark to set some nearby flammable material
alight. Water magic includes feats such as purify water and turning
water to ice. Many materials have the properties of multiple elements--
mud is Earth and Water; lightning is Air and Fire; a living creature is
made up of all four elements; etc. The more elements a Feat involves,
the more difficult it will be.

<P>
In-Game Requirements: Elemental magic is often quick to perform. Mana
costs vary with the scope of the feat being performed. Parting a river
to allow safe crossing will take much more mana than magically bringing
a small cup of water to a boil. (Parting a river-- or a larger body of
water-- can be done by many elementalists working in concert, or with a
fabled and powerful Staff of Water Command.)

<P>
Restrictions: Creating some amount of an element (a fireball, for
example) requires the Conjuration skill. Transforming one element into
another requires the Transmutation skill. Calling forth an Elemental-- a
powerful construct imbued with the very essence of one of the four
Elements-- requires Shamanism or Sorcery.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Extra Sensory Perception:</SPAN> Perceiving things with more than the
usual five senses.

<P>
Magical Feats: Examples of ``Esper'' magic include Empathy, Telepathy,
Clairvoyance (seeing at a distance), Clairaudience (hearing at a
distance), Astral Travel (moving out of body, or taking a soul journey
to another plane), Divination, and Sensing Auras. An Esper mage also
knows how to block Esper magic. Espers excel at detecting the presence
or patterns of magic and mana.

<P>
In-Game Requirements: Esper magic requires concentration and
focus. Typical rituals are relatively short (a matter of a few minutes),
but may require a period of purification and meditation before
beginning. Espers are vulnerable when experiencing out-of-body travel,
and should arrange protection or safety for their physical bodies while
their spirits roam.

<P>
Restrictions: The information received through Esper magic is not always
crystal-clear, and may be subject to misinterpretation. Any
distractions, even slight ones, while the Esper is attempting extra
sensory perception requires a Willpower roll to ignore (Difficulty Level
equal to that set for the magical feat itself).

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Kineticism:</SPAN> The magic of motion.

<P>
Magical Feats: Levitation, Telekinesis, Teleportation, Animation of
objects, and magical ``Force'' shields or weapons are all possible.

<P>
In-Game Requirements: Most kinetic feats require concentration,
especially when they involve precisely targeted movement. Mana is
expended to start something in motion, and then concentration and
willpower are used to direct that motion. Teleportation requires the
Kineticist to be at the originating point (although he can Teleport
either himself or another), and also to have recently been to the
destination point. Without a clear picture of the destination in mind, a
Kineticist may ``miss'' during a Teleportation, with potentially dire
consequences such as appearing a bit too far above (or below!) ground
level....

<P>
Restrictions: In the case of magical ``force'' weapons (such as a magic
missile of harm), the GM may require the player to roll once against the
character's Kineticism skill (to create the magic force) and again using
either the character's Kineticism skill or Willpower attribute to direct
the missile. A magical ``force'' shield could be accomplished as one
task-- the creation of a magic force that moves with the target and
blocks contact with anything physically harmful. If a Kineticist wishes
to animate an object but also grant it some self-direction or even
intelligence, the Shamanism or Sorcery skill is required to bind a
spirit to the animated object.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Mesmerism:</SPAN> Affecting minds with magic. Mesmerism may be opposed by the
Willpower attribute.

<P>
Magical Feats: This skill covers Hypnosis, Illusion, Mind-Control (of
humans or animals), and other mind-affecting magic. The ubiquitous
``Sleep'' spell falls under this skill. ``Invisibility'' can also be
accomplished with Mesmerism. At its simplest level, Mesmerism can
confuse a creature's senses. At its most insidious, it can completely
enslave a creature's mind, bending it to the Mesmerist's will.

<P>
In-Game Requirements: Mesmerism works only against living creatures that
also have at least a rudimentary mind. A Mesmerist must be within a
certain distance of his targets to be able to affect their minds-- the
distance varies with the difficulty of the feat being attempted. The
more complex the ``confusion of the senses'' being attempted, the more
difficult the feat. The more creatures to be Mesmerized, the more mana
is required. The same goes for intelligence, to a point. Normal animal
intelligence, such as that of a dog or a horse, is the easiest for most
Mesmerists. Affecting the minds of creatures that are more or less
intelligent than ``normal animal'' requires more mana to overcome the
target's intelligence (or lack thereof).

<P>
Restrictions: The GM may rule that certain non-human creatures
(especially intelligent ones) simply have minds that are too ``alien'' for
a Mesmerist to affect. Mammals will be the easiest to affect. Insects,
with their tiny and differently-wired brains, are not easy at all. Any
creature with a Willpower attribute may oppose Mesmerism (resolve as an
opposed action, Mesmerism skill vs. target's Willpower attribute), plus
any applicable modifiers.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Necromancy:</SPAN> ``Death Magic.'' Necromancy is a ``Black Art,''
although not as dangerous to wield as Sorcery.

<P>
Magical Feats: Creating (or destroying) and controlling undead
creatures, summoning spirits of the dead for divination, and driving a
spirit from a living body are all possible with Necromancy. Necromancers
can also cause hauntings or release ghostly spirits to the afterlife.
The most powerful Necromancers may be able to bring the dead back to
life (a far more difficult feat than simply animating their corpses).

<P>
In-Game Requirements: Necromancers require access to the raw materials
typically needed for their magic-- dead bodies. Most cultures frown on
such uses of earthly remains.

<P>
Restrictions: As Necromancy is illegal in many cultures, most
Necromancers have the fault Secret (see above). The GM may require
Necromancers to have the Kineticism skill to animate corpses (as
zombies, skeletons, or other undead creatures), or she may substitute
Shamanism as the means by which a spirit is tied to a corpse to create
an undead creature. A generous GM will allow Necromancers to use their
own methods to call the spirits or raise the dead. Necromancy may be
restricted to non-player characters.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Runes:</SPAN> The use of arcane symbols (runes, sigils, hieroglyphics,
and other marks) to cast spells and enchant items.

<P>
Magical Feats: Runes are symbols that are inherently pre-disposed to
attracting mana and shaping magical power toward a desired end. Some
runes are used to enhance other Scholarly Magic skills, aiding the
mage's concentration (lowering the Difficulty Level of a given magical
feat), tapping into or focusing magical energy (decreasing the power
point cost), or delaying or modifying the effects of a magical feat
(triggering the actual spell when certain circumstances are met, for
example). Other runes act more like spells, with the drawing of the rune
in the prescribed manner being the only ritual required to perform the
magical feat associated with that rune. Most Artificers are well versed
in runes, as runes are used in preparing spell scrolls and in many other
magical items. Artificing can also be used to make a rune and its
effects more permanent. For example, a Sigil of Warding drawn above the
archway to a room would repel an intruder only once, unless applied in
conjunction with the Artificing skill.

<P>
In-Game Requirements: The appropriate rune must be carefully and
correctly drawn. Simple runes may be traced in the air or on the ground
with a finger. More complex runes may require the mage to draw them in
blood on a ritually prepared skin, or painstakingly create them in
colored sands on a flat, swept surface, or perform some other equally
detailed ritual to create and invoke the rune. Generally, the more
complex the magical feat being attempted, the more complex or numerous
the runes required, hence the more time required in applying the runes.

<P>
Restrictions: Each rune or symbol has a different purpose, and the mage
must know the appropriate rune for a given magical feat. The Gamemaster
may create a list of runes or other symbols the mage knows, with brief
descriptions of how they may be used in the game.

<P>
Note: When used in conjunction with other Scholarly Magic skills, the
player may roll against the Rune skill even if Runes is not the lowest
skill level involved-- but only if the runes involved are directly
related to the magical feat.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Shamanism:</SPAN> Spirit Magic. Shamans interact with spirits of
varying powers. Spirits include ancestral spirits, anima (spirits that
imbue every object; some anima are more powerful than others), and
``guardian spirits.''

<P>
Magical Feats: A Shaman can cause any magical effect the spirits he
deals with are capable of creating. Shamans can also exorcise
troublesome spirits and ghosts, and even creatures (or constructs or
demons) called through Conjuration, Necromancy, or Sorcery.

<P>
In-Game Requirements: Shamans don't typically need to expend much mana,
as any magical feat beyond the initial contact with a spirit is
performed by the spirit itself. Once contacted, a spirit may require a
bribe, or bargain, or some other method of persuasion to actually
perform the requested feat. Spirits must be honored, with each spirit
requiring a different ritual. Dancing, sacrificing (of goods, animals,
or even sentient creatures), and singing are often essential features of
Shamanistic rituals.

<P>
Restrictions: The Shamanism roll made when a Shaman character wishes to
perform a magic feat determines whether or not the Shaman successfully
contacts the desired spirit.  An additional skill, such as Flatter,
Intimidate, Parley/Negotiate or other persuasive means may be needed to
convince the spirit to actually perform the magic feat requested of
it. Shamans who fail to uphold their part of any spirit bargain tend not
to be able to practice Shamanism well for long. The Gamemaster may
require a Shaman to use the Extra Sensory Perception skill for
communicating with the spirits through trances and out-of-body
experiences. Artificing is required to create shamanistic objects
(charms, talismans, and the like) imbued with spirits that perform magic
for the wielder.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Sorcery:</SPAN> The ``Black Arts.'' Sorcery relies on summoning demons
and other powerful, evil beings to trick or bribe or force them into
doing the sorcerer's bidding.

<P>
Magical Feats: Anything that can be done by a demon, devil, or evil
spirit can be accomplished with Sorcery-- provided the sorcerer is
powerful enough to summon the required entity and crafty enough to
convince it to do his bidding. Sorcerers may gain innate magical gifts
and other magical powers, either permanently or temporarily, through
their dealings with powerful evil beings.

<P>
In-Game Requirements: There are three facets to sorcerous dealings--
summoning the evil being; controlling the evil being (by holding it
within a circle of power, for example); and persuading it to do the
summoner's bidding. The summoned being will seek to twist or distort or
otherwise alter any deal struck with the sorcerer, so sorcerers must
take care to protect themselves and negotiate their deals carefully.

<P>
Restrictions: Penalties of failure are severe, and often gruesome. Evil
beings do not take kindly to being summoned against their will, and even
less kindly to forced servitude.  Should a sorcerer's control slip, even
for an instant, the demon or spirit will do its best to harm its
captor. Few cultures welcome sorcerers, so the Secret Fault may be
required. The Gamemaster may (and probably should) restrict Sorcery to
non-player characters, or to PCs with specifically crafted backgrounds
(such as a sorcerer-hunter who was once a practicing sorcerer himself).

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Transmutation:</SPAN> Turning things into other things. Living
creatures may oppose such transformations with Willpower.

<P>
Magical Feats: The more unalike the original object and the transmutated
object are, the harder the feat. Turning living objects into inanimate
objects (such as statues) or vice versa is especially difficult. Turning
water to wine, or a glutton into a hog, are easier. Such transformations
are usually of short duration; it takes much skill and power to affect a
permanent transformation.

<P>
In-Game Requirements: Transmutation is a difficult art, often requiring
much mana. Affecting a permanent transformation usually requires the use
of a powerful enchanted item, such as a staff of transmutation or wand
of frog princes.

<P>
Restrictions: If the magician's target has a Willpower attribute, it may
resist the magical change. Resolve as an Opposed Action, the mage's
Transmutation skill versus the target's Willpower attribute, plus or
minus any modifiers the GM sets.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Wizardry:</SPAN> The ``Wise Arts.'' The most scholarly of scholarly
magic, Wizardry concerns itself with the laws of magic, the flow of
mana, and the underlying structures of spells, incantations, and
enchantments. Wizards know many ways to gather mana, and how to use it
efficiently.

<P>
Magical Feats: Wizardry can detect or analyze magic and magic items,
dispel magic, alter mana flows, and perform similar feats that directly
affect the forces that make magic possible. Wizardry can also lower the
cost in power points of a given feat (see Mana, below).

<P>
In-Game Requirements: When applying Wizardry, the Wizard must take time
to consider applicable magical laws, mana flows in the area, and any
circumstances present at the time of casting that could affect the
outcome.

<P>
Restrictions: The GM may require the player to refer to ``laws of magic''
(Similarity, Contagion, or whatever ``laws'' are appropriate for the game
world) , create rhyming ``incantations,'' or otherwise embellish the
description of what the mage is doing when using Wizardry in a magical
feat.

<P>
Note: When used in conjunction with other Scholarly Magic skills,
Wizardry may provide a +1 bonus to the character's skill roll. This
occurs only if the character's Wizardry skill is higher than one or more
of the other Scholarly Magic skills involved (see below).

<P>

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Magical Power (Mana)
</H3>

<P>
Casting scholarly magic requires mana, or power points. Truly trivial
magic (with effects similar to those attainable with Hedge Magic) uses
negligible amounts of mana, but most scholarly magic requires one or
more power points.

<P>
Each level of the Magical Talent: Scholarly Gift grants the character 5
power points to use in performing magic.

<P>
The number of Gifts used to purchase Magical Talent also affects how
much mana the character can channel and control. One Magical Talent Gift
allows the character to perform trivial magic, and magical feats costing
1 power point. Two Magical Talent Gifts increase that to 2 power points,
and so on.

<P>
Attempting to channel more power than the character can normally handle
requires a Willpower roll, Difficulty Level equal to Fair plus 1 per
power point over the character's usual limit. Thus, a character with 2
Magical Talent Gifts attempting to channel 4 power points to perform a
magical feat must roll Willpower against a Difficulty Level of Great
(Fair +2). Failure results in the loss of one level of Health by each
level the Difficulty Level is missed. (A Mediocre result with a Great
Difficulty Level would result in the loss of 3 Health levels; see
Fatigue, below.)

<P>
Power points may be regained at the rate of 1 point per 2 hours of sleep
or 1 hour of undisturbed meditation, up to the number allowed by the
magician's Magical Talent Gifts.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Fatigue
</H3>

<P>
In addition to requiring mana, Scholarly Magic is fatiguing (much like
Hedge Magic). The character's Health attribute drops one level for each
use. If Health level falls below Terrible, the character is exhausted
and collapses-- treat as the fatigue equivalent of ``Incapacitated.'' A
level of fatigued Health is regained simply by resting 15 minutes.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN> Performing Magical Feats
</H3>

<P>
When a character wishes to perform magic, the player should describe to
the Gamemaster the magical results the character wishes to achieve. The
more detail included in the description, the better. Scholarly magic
depends heavily on the magician's concentration and clarity of thought,
and if the player isn't paying much attention to what the character
wishes to accomplish, the GM may assume the character isn't, either.

<P>
The player may also describe the magician character's actions, and
aspects of the ritual being used to perform the magic feat, if
desired. Including poetic incantations (especially if it's good poetry)
and other ``flavor'' in the description of the ritual may be worth bonuses
to the character's skill.

<P>
There are several aspects that should be considered for each magical
feat:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Skill required (Difficulty Level)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Mana required (power points that will be used)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Time to perform (from an instant to years)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Materials required (if any)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Optional modifying circumstances (lots possible)
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Skill:</SPAN> The more complex the desired results, the higher the
Difficulty Level the GM should set for a magical feat. Difficulty Levels
start at Fair for simple magic, such as creating-- but not
controlling-- fire, or speaking with a spirit that's already ``awake''
and interested in communicating. Difficulty can range up to Legendary or
even beyond, for god-like magical feats. Some ``trivial'' magic may have
Difficulty Levels of Mediocre, but any magic requiring power points
should be of at least Fair Difficulty.

<P>
Once the Difficulty Level is set, the player rolls against the
magician's Scholarly Magic skill. Use the lowest skill if the feat
requires more than one Scholarly Magic skill.

<P>
Example: Enchanting a Staff of Dragon Summoning and Control requires
skill in Artificing, Conjuration, and Mesmerism. An enchanter with
Artificing: Mediocre, Conjuration: Fair, and Mesmerism: Good would roll
on a skill level of Mediocre.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Mana:</SPAN> The more powerful or all-encompassing the desired
results, the more power points will be required. ``Trivial'' magic may
require so little mana that power point use isn't even tracked. This
doesn't mean a mage can go around popping off trivial spells all day,
though, since even trivial spells requiring no power points will fatigue
the mage.

<P>
Note that the Difficulty Level and the mana required are not related;
one measures complexity, the other power. Creating a small colored flame
that dances in a pattern that recreates an ancient battle between
wizards may be of Legendary Difficulty, but require only one power
point.

<P>
Note also that some magical feats require more power points than any but
the most Legendary Wizards have access to. Such feats are possible,
either through pooling the power points of more than one magician, or
drawing on ``mana vessels'' containing stored power points (see
Artificing, above). Some rare materials are natural ``mana vessels.''

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Time:</SPAN> Generally speaking, the more complex the magical feat
desired, the greater the time required in preparing. This is usually
true of powerful spells as well. Complex, powerful spells should take a
lot of time to prepare. You can trade Time for Difficulty Level, if you
wish. The less time you take in preparing the magical incantation,
enchantment, or other feat, the greater the Difficulty Level. Likewise,
increasing the preparation and casting time may, at the GM's option,
lower the Difficulty Level.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Materials:</SPAN> If the GM wishes, magical feats may require the use
of materials related to the effects desired; sulphur or coal for fire, a
feather for a flying spell, and so on. Some magical feats may be
performed with nothing more than the magician's concentration or some
words of power; others may require rare and precious materials.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Modifiers:</SPAN> The GM may apply any modifiers desired. Examples include
bonuses for using special materials (or using materials at all if not
normally required); for performing magic in naturally magical
surroundings; for applying any ``laws of magic'' the GM allows (if they
have the Wizardry skill). Penalties may be applied for distracting
circumstances, or the GM may require a Willpower roll for the mage to
avoid becoming distracted and possibly losing control of the magic he's
wielding.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN> Determining Results
</H3>

<P>
The GM judges whether a feat is within the character's capabilities-- if
not, she should warn the player that attempting greater magics than the
character is ready for is dangerous. The GM also determines what the
actual result will be. Magic in Fantasy Fudge is an art, not a science;
and the same ``spell'' cast in the same way may have varying results.

<P>
In general, the greater the success in performing a magical feat, the
closer to the desired effects the results will be. Spectacular successes
may carry unexpected benefits, such as less time required to cast, lower
power point cost, and the like. Abysmal failures should be spectacular,
as well. Use your imagination, but don't allow the results to outright
kill the character (unless he's a sorcerer)! Less abysmal failures will
produce unexpected and possibly unwanted results, including greater
power point cost with little or nothing to show for it.

</H3>

<P>
It's a good idea to take some time before play to work out some
``standard'' spells a scholarly mage is likely to use. Ask the player what
spells the character is likely to have sought out, and work out some
sample Difficulty Levels, Mana costs, and required time and materials
for those spells. Feel free to ``steal'' spells from other games to help
build a spell list. Consider the spell's desired affect rather than the
actual game mechanics used in the game it was designed for, and base the
difficulty and power levels on that.

<P>
Spell descriptions should be considered guidelines rather than strict
definitions of spell effects and costs. Magical feats and their results
are meant to be improvised by the Gamemaster as well as by the
character.

5-Point Fudge uses Fudge Miracles (section&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#sec:fudgemiracles">7.2</A>) as a
basis for Clerical Magic.

<P>
The Gift Divine Favor is required to use Clerical Magic. It's possible
to play a priest without Divine Favor-- simply choose the Professional
skill Counseling/Priest and assemble an appropriate set of skills. But
such a priest has no ability to use Clerical Magic. Note also that you
don't have to be an ordained priest in any religion to have Divine Favor
or to use Clerical Magic.

<P>
Skills available to a character with Divine Favor include the mundane
and the supernatural. The supernatural are cast strictly through the
power of the God or gods served by the cleric. If the cleric's behavior
is inconsistent with the God's desires, this ability is withdrawn, at
least temporarily.

<P>
Supernatural skills in the following list are detailed-- any other skill
is mundane and uses the description in the Skill list. This list assumes
a benign deity who grants free will and supernatural aid to its
followers in times of crisis. Other skills may be appropriate for other
types of clerics-- plant magic for Druids, for example, and more spirit
magic for shamans. Evil clerics have a different skill list-- your

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Calling on Divine Favor
</H2>

<P>
When a cleric with Divine Favor calls on his deity, make an Unopposed
action roll against the specific Clerical Magic skill (see Action
Resolution, above).  On a Good or better result, the cleric's petition
for divine favor is answered. For clerical skills where exact results
aren't quantified (such as Healing), the better the rolled result, the
better the answer to the prayer. For example, a Good result may reduce
one wound by one wound level, while a Superb result could heal an
injured character entirely.

<P>
On a Fair or Mediocre result, the favor simply isn't granted. On a Poor
or worse result, the deity may be angry with the cleric. The GM should
consider the character's recent actions, especially in regard to the
cleric's religious beliefs. If there are any reasons for the cleric's
deity to be less than satisfied with service rendered, this is the time
for that to become abundantly clear. If the cleric's behavior has been
exemplary (so far as the deity is concerned), a failure simply means the
deity was busy with other things, or considered the favor unimportant
(or counter to its own desires) for some reason.

<P>
Modifiers: The GM can apply any modifiers she thinks
applicable. Suggestions may be found in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#sec:fudgemiracles">7.2</A>
of the core Fudge rules, and include +1 or more if the cleric has
recently been furthering the deity's cause, or -1 if the most recent
petition for Divine Favor ended in a Poor or worse result.

For each non-human race in the game world, create a ``racial package''

<P>
Determine how many ``Gifts'' the racial package is worth, and require
that many Gifts be spent (or attribute levels reduced, or extra Faults
incurred). Some racial packages will balance out, not requiring the use
of a Gift slot. Some racial packages may actually qualify as Faults,
allowing the character to compensate with higher Attributes or
additional Gifts.

Some Skills, Gifts, Faults, Supernormal Powers, etc. may be unique to
members of particular races.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Equipping Characters
</H1>

<P>
The Gamemaster may wish to define a ``starting equipment'' package that
all characters will have (unless they took the Poor Fault or Wealthy
Gift). This may include such things as clothing (perhaps one good set
and an everyday set), footgear, and weapons appropriate to their Combat
skills. They may also have travel or camping gear (such as wineskins or
canteens, a messkit, a tinderbox, and other items common in the campaign
world).

<P>
Players should be allowed to customize their characters' equipment list
a bit, adding things that make sense given their skills. Characters with
Climbing skill may have rope, a grappling hook, iron spikes, or similar
equipment that can aid in climbing.

<P>
Characters should also be allowed to purchase equipment-- spending their
hard-earned wealth for the privilege, of course. The GM may want to
prepare an ``equipment list'' with average prices for common items
available in the campaign world. Appropriate equipment lists may also be
borrowed or adapted from other roleplaying games.

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Damage Factors and Equipment
</H2>

<P>
For weapons, armor, and other equipment likely to be used in combat
situations, the player or GM should determine Offensive and Defensive
Damage Factors.

<P>
Damage Factors are simply the sum of damage-related modifiers for each
weapon or armor type. These factors will be used to determine damage
points and wound levels in combat (see Wounds, section ).

<P>
Sample ``Wound Factors'' are detailed on in
section&nbsp;<A HREF="node9.html#sec:woundfactors">4.53</A>. Use these to determine the ``Offensive
Damage Factor'' for each character/weapon combination.

<P>
For example, a character with Good Strength wielding a longsword would
have an Offensive Damage Factor of +4 (+1 for Strength; +2 for a large
one-handed weapon; +1 for sharpness). A character with Fair Strength
wielding the same weapon would have an ODF of +3 (no Strength
bonus). Remember to include any bonuses or penalties due to Scale when
dealing with non-human combatants.

<P>
Then determine the character's ``Defensive Damage Factor'' for both
``unarmored'' and ``armored'' (if the character possesses armor). Modifiers
range from +0 for no armor to +4 or more for heavy or magical
armor. Scale and Gifts such as Tough Hide can also affect a character's
Defensive Damage Factor.

<P>
After each game session, award Fudge Points (see
section&nbsp;<A HREF="node6.html#sec:fudgepoints">1.36</A>) to the characters. Fantasy Fudge suggests
1-3 Fudge Points per gaming session. The GM may reward really good
roleplaying and problem solving with more Fudge Points. Fudge Points may
be used to ``fudge'' a game result, or they may be saved up and traded for
Experience Points at a rate of 3 Fudge Points = 1 EP. The EPs may then
be spent to raise skills or attributes, or acquire additional Gifts,
etc., as outlined in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node10.html#chap:chardevel">5</A>: Character Development.

Where would a fantasy roleplaying game be without a setting? Wherever
you want it to be!

<P>
Use Fantasy Fudge with your favorite fantasy world, whether that's one
of your own creation, a fictional world brought to life by your favorite
fantasy author, a published fantasy game world, or any of a number of
game worlds created by other gamers. The Grey Ghost website

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN> Action Resolution</A>
</H1>

<P>
There are two types of actions in Fantasy Fudge-- Opposed Actions, and
Unopposed Actions.

<P>
A fight between two creatures will most often be resolved as a series of
Opposed Actions.

<P>
An attempt to climb a cliff will most often be resolved as an Unopposed
Action. The Gamemaster sets the ``Difficulty Level'' that must be met or
surpassed for the action to succeed.

<P>
Note that very easy actions should be automatic; no need to
roll. Likewise with impossible actions; the character just can't do it,
and will fail in the attempt no matter how lucky the player is with
dice.

<P>
If the character doesn't have an appropriate skill to attempt a task,
the GM may allow the player to roll on the default level for that skill
(usually Poor). The GM may call for a roll against an attribute instead
of a skill whenever it seems appropriate (asking for an Agility check
rather than a Climbing check, for example), although an unskilled
character should get a negative modifier to the dice roll.

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Unopposed Actions
</H2>

<P>
The Gamemaster sets a Difficulty Level for any unopposed action. This
includes most ranged weapon combat-- it's difficult for a character to
actually hinder someone's attempt to fire at him, although if he has
Quick Reflexes he could attempt to dodge out of the line of fire.

<P>
The Difficulty Level should take into account everything but the
character's skill (and modifiers to that skill provided by equipment or
character condition, including injuries). A task with a Difficulty Level
of Poor is very easy, while something with a Difficulty Level of Superb
is very hard. For legendary feats, set the Difficulty Level even higher
(Superb +2, for example). When in doubt, set the Difficulty Level to
Fair. That will give a character with a Fair skill a 62% chance of
succeeding.

<P>

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Opposed Actions
</H2>

<P>
When characters engage in opposed actions (including hand-to-hand
combat), the players of each contestant roll the dice, add the indicated
modifiers to the appropriate skill level, and compare the results. The
GM rolls for all NPCs.

<P>
Relative Degree measures the difference between the results. If one
character has a Good success in an Opposed Action, and the second
character has a Mediocre success, the Relative Degree is +2 from the
winner's perspective, and -2 from the loser's perspective. In combat,
the winner adds the Relative Degree to his Offensive Damage Factor to
determine the number of damage points inflicted.

<P>
If it helps, you can convert the characters' combat skills to their
numerical equivalents before adding all modifiers (including the random
dice roll). Alternatively, put your finger on the Terrible-- Superb
Trait Scale list, and move up one line for every +1 or down one line for
every -1.

</H1>

<P>
In Fudge, a combat ``round'' can be defined as the Gamemaster
wishes. Fantasy Fudge assumes one ``round'' (roll of the dice) equals
about 3 seconds of combat action. Actions occur simultaneously.

<P>
Combat can be resolved as an Unopposed action if it involves ranged
combat, a combatant being caught unawares (giving a ``free attack'' to
the opponent), or a ``cannon-fodder'' type of NPC (see Special
Circumstances, below). Otherwise, treat combat as a series of Opposed
Actions.

<P>
The players of characters engaged in opposed actions will roll the dice
once each combat round; the result determines the winner of that round.

</H2>

<P>
A Terrible hit never damages the target, even if it beats the opponent's
sub-Terrible result.

<P>
When multiple opponents attack a single target, the lone fighter is at
-1 to skill for each foe beyond the first. The player rolls once;
compare the result with each of the opponents' rolls. The solo combatant
has to defeat or tie all of the opponents in order to inflict a
wound. If he beats all of his foes, he may hit one of his
choice. Otherwise, he can only wound another whose result is at least
two levels below his. The lone fighter takes multiple wounds if two or
more enemies hit him.

<P>
Unlike ``star'' NPCs, who are treated much like PCs, ``cannon fodder''
opponents will always get results equal to their trait levels. You can
treat this as an Unopposed Action with a Difficulty Level equal to the
NPC's combat skill.

<P>
When ``cannon fodder'' NPCs gang up on a player character, use the
``multiple opponents'' rule above, but compare the outnumbered fighter's
result with the NPCs' combat skill levels (not ``rolled degrees'').

<P>
The boxes below the wound levels represent how many of each wound type a
echaracter can take. The player checks off one box for each wound
received. A 6-point wound requires the ``Very Hurt'' box to be checked,
and so on. If there is no open box for a given wound result, the
character takes the next highest wound for which there is an open box.

<P>
A wounded character suffers penalties to most actions:

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Scratch:</SPAN> no penalty

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Hurt:</SPAN> -1 to most actions

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Very Hurt:</SPAN> -2 to most actions

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Incapacitated:</SPAN> incapable of any but the most basic, painfully slow
actions

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Near Death:</SPAN> unconscious, will die in less than an hour unless helped

<P>
Penalties are not cumulative. Only the penalty for the highest recorded
wound level counts. Scratches go away after a battle, provided the
character has five or ten minutes to attend to them. See
section&nbsp;<A HREF="node9.html#sec:healing">4.8</A> for rules for healing wounds.

<P>
A Situational Roll is used to show luck, outside events, or the overall
situation. It isn't based on any character traits. Simply roll the
dice. A Situational Roll of -2 gives a Poor result; the situation is not
good.

<P>
The GM can use a Situational Roll to determine anything from the weather
to a non-player character's attitude.

<P>
A Situational Roll can also be used to check a creature's ``morale''
during combat, especially when the creature is first wounded, and again
if it becomes Very Hurt. A -1 or worse Situational Roll in the midst of
combat may mean that the NPC will try to surrender or run away. You may
add the NPC's current modifiers due to wounds to the ``morale'' roll. A
Hurt creature with a -1 Situational Roll would actually be experiencing
a Poor reaction to the combat, and would probably be doing whatever it
could to get out of the fight....

The basilisk, sometimes called the cockatrice by peasants, is a grayish
serpent that grows to no more than two feet in length. It has white
markings on its head that resemble a crown. Popular legend holds that
the basilisk can kill with a mere glance, but this is untrue. The
basilisk's danger lies in its venom. The venomous breath of a basilisk
withers plants, scorches the earth and can kill any creature up to the
size of an elephant.

<P>
In combat, a basilisk breathes a nearly invisible, cone-shaped cloud of
venom that affects foes up to fifteen feet away. Any living creature
caught in the cloud must make a Health roll at Great Difficulty or be
immediately slain.

<P>
Basilisks are also dangerous in melee combat. Any blow that successfully
damages the creature can cause the creature's foul venom to pass up
through the weapon and affect the wielder. Any time a Basilisk is struck
with a melee weapon, the GM should roll a dF. On a roll of -1, the
victim must make a Health roll as above or die.

<P>
A basilisk is created from an egg that is laid by a cockerel and then
incubated by a toad in a dung heap.

Ghosts are the leftover psychic residue of someone who has
perished. Generally speaking, there is no physical method of removing or
harming them. Some ghosts can be put to rest if a special task is
completed. Usually the completion of the task is what makes the spirit
hang around after its original owner perished. Ghosts are generally
resentful creatures and their deep emotional disturbance puts animals at
unease.

<P>
Ghosts may be influenced, confined, banished, or released by various
applications of Clerical Magic or Scholarly Magic (especially Shamanism
or Necromancy).

Ghouls (also know as Gh&#251;ls and Raveners) are once-human creatures whose
minds have been destroyed. They have grey, jellylike flesh, yellow
fangs, and filthy, broken nails which infect their victims with a
sinister toxin.

<P>
Ghouls usually inhabit underground lairs near graveyards and similar
places, where a supply of their noxious ``food'' may be found. Ghouls
usually travel in packs of 3-12, with the most powerful and intelligent
member as a leader. Their usual prey is carrion, but they will attack
living humans if driven to it by hunger or by a powerful master.

<P>
Ghouls attack with their claws and teeth in a mindless frenzy. The
poison in their claws drains vitality. The victim must make a Health
roll, difficulty level Fair, or lose one level of health per combat
round. Victims reduced to below Terrible Health become stiff and
helpless.

<P>
Any human succumbing to a ghoul attack will be taken to their lair and
buried. This live internment, in addition to the ghoulish poison,
deranges the mind and causes physical changes that result in the victim
becoming a ghoul. If sufficiently hungry, the ghouls may simply devour
the victim.

<P>
Ghouls can be turned by the Repel Undead Clerical Magic skill,
difficulty level Good. The clerical Ward ability keeps ghouls completely
at bay.  A clerical Healing can neutralize the poison if a victim has
not entirely become a ghoul.

through solid rock and are a menace to explorers in deep caverns.

<P>
A worm's favorite attack is to stick its head out of a hole and swallow
any creature of Scale 6 or less. Victims may attempt to dodge (Opposed
Action, Victim's Agility versus the worm's Combat Skill). If the worm
wins, the victim is swallowed.

<P>
A creature may attempt to attack a worm from the inside., difficulty
level Terrible (any attack of Terrible or better has a chance of doing
damage) and DDF +1. There is little room to swing weapons. 15 points of
cumulative damage done to the same area within the worm allows a victim
to cut an escape hole, or might cause the worm to regurgitate.

<P>
Meanwhile, the victim is being digested. He or she takes a Scratch each
combat round after being swallowed. If the victim has no Scratch boxes
left, the Scratch will be a Hurt; if there are no Hurt boxes left on the
victim's wound track, the result will be Very Hurt, and so on until
death.

<P>
If attacked from the rear, a giant worm will lash out with a bone-like
stinger on its tail. It can do this the same round as attempting to
swallow.

Goblins are short (4<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img10.png"
 ALT="$'$"></SPAN> tall), evil humanoids that are found in wild
forests or mountainous areas. Goblins are tribal and matriarchal. A
tribe will normally consist of between 50 and 200 individuals. The
leader of the tribe is usually a female of prodigious size and foul
temperament.

<P>
Goblins are not particularly fearsome opponents in battle unless they
are backed by overwhelming numbers or led by a charismatic
general. Goblin tribes go through periods of very high birth rates every
5-10 years. This results in periodic invasions of surrounding lands by
hordes of goblins on the move due to overpopulation and starvation.

<P>
Goblins fear and hate dwarves, since dwarves often enslave them and put
them to work in their mines. The average goblin is armed with a
wicked-looking serrated short sword and protected by a patchwork of
leather armor.

<P>
With their speed and ability to move quietly, great weasels can attack
their prey without warning, gaining an Unopposed attack, Difficulty Fair
in the first combat round. If a great weasel wins an attack with a
relative degree of +4 or more, it has bitten a major blood vessel. The
victim will bleed to death in several minutes, unless first aid or
healing is applied. The victim must make a Health roll (Difficulty Fair)
every minute or bleed to death. GMs who allow NPCs to have Fudge points
should give great weasels one point.

Its origins shrouded in mystery, the hydra is one of the most feared
creatures. It appears as a large reptile, with many heads. Its
regeneration makes it nearly unstoppable and its appetite is insatiable.

<P>
Each of a hydra's head can attack independently. For combat purposes,
treat each head as a scale +2 creature whose teeth do +5 damage due to
sharpness and strength.

<P>
Any wound of Incapacitated or Near Death inflicted on a head severs it
from its neck. A new head will regenerate to replace the lost one. If
the hydra makes a Superb Health check, two heads are regenerated. The
regeneration process takes 4 combat rounds. A Hurt or worse wound
inflicted by fire will prevent regeneration. Magic weapons may have
similar effects.

The hyeena is a horrible beast that resembles a large hound with a spiny
ridge running along its back. It lives in tombs or catacombs and feeds
on the dead. It will also dig up graves in the search for bodies. Some
hyeenas stalk rural areas by night and prey on shepherds or late
travelers.

<P>
The hyeena has an unusual magical defense. Any creature that treads on a
hyeena's shadow is immediately struck dumb and unable to speak. The
effect lasts until the hyeena is killed or an hour has passed.

<P>
The hyeena also has an uncanny talent for imitating the human voice, and
uses this trick to lure its prey into an ambush.

<P>
Alchemists prize the hyeena's eyes because they can be distilled into
small stones that can be used to foretell the future.  An alchemist will
pay a good fee for a pair of hyeena eyes if they are fresh or have been
properly preserved in salt or strong alcohol.

Imps are small demonic entities, which are either summoned or sent to
this plane to aid a sorcerer or priest in some evil scheme. Imps come in
many shapes, from man-like to grotesque.

<P>
Imps are skilled in Demonic Magic, which works the same way Scholarly
Magic does. Demonic Magic excels at magical feats that cause confusion
and misery. Most imps have 5 magical power points, and can channel 1- or
2-point spells.

Medusae are cursed by gods. In ages past, the mother of all medusae
compared her own beauty with that of the gods. For this, she and all her
descendants were made so hideous, that any who saw them were turned to
stone. (Any character who sees a medusa's face must make a Willpower
check at a Great Difficulty level, or turn to stone.)

<P>
A medusa may attempt to take residence in an old villa or abandoned
home. There, slowly but surely, a statue garden will begin to grow. The
services of a hero may be needed to find a way of killing the poor
creature. It has been rumored that when a medusa is slain, her victims
return to the flesh.

<P>
Rathent are odd creatures, most likely the result of some magical
hybridization gone awry. They resemble humanoid birds, with large,
curved beaks and offset eyes. Feathers cover their head, upper torso and
arms. Their plumage is generally dark or mottled and unkempt and
greasy. Many Rathent have hands ending talon-like claws. Most Rathent
have human-like leg structure. Rare individuals will have bird-like legs
or vestigial wings, and are generally regarded as gruk (retard or
throwback). This is a reflection of cultural bias rather than actual
ability or intelligence.

<P>
The structure of Rathent society is loosely tribal with the strongest or
most cunning being the skwarka (chieftain). The skwarka leads the tribe
in battle and receives the most prestige and breeding privileges.

<P>
Rathent are extremely protective of their females, as they have a
relatively low birthrate. Only one in five members of a typical Rathent
tribe are female.

<P>
Rathent males serve as hunters and generally engage in banditry,
thievery, and murder to eke out an existence. They are cowardly
scavengers by nature and will feed on carrion with glee when there is
nothing better.

<P>
Most Rathent provide only for themselves, but offer tribute to the
skwarka and his harem. Warriors that do not pay tribute regularly to the
skwarka are either exiled or more likely killed.

<P>
Rathent may be encountered in semi-civilized areas on the outskirts of
forests and mountains. Their villages are clusters of rude tree houses
similar to nests in structure. The skwarka's nest is the largest and
centrally located, and is built into the largest tree available.

<P>
Rathent have fair craftsmanship skills, but rarely produce anything of
exceptional quality. Most of their weaponry is scavenged or stolen. When
left to their own means they will produce javelins, war darts, and
spears. Rathent armor is usually cobbled together from bits and pieces
scavenged in their raids.

<P>
Some Rathent have an innate talent for simple magic. Clerical Magic and
Hedge Magic is most common. Scholarly Magic (Elementalism or Necromancy)
is also possible, but no Rathent will have more than one level of the
Magical Talent: Scholarly Magic Gift. Rathents with Magical Talent are
known as kuzkwa. Most are female. All magically talented Rathent are
sterile and considered sexless. Many are also albino. These Rathent
serve as shamans and spiritual advisors.

<P>
Rathent spirituality is a grim affair centered around the malevolent
figure Kzukwa-skwark (Old Lord Dread). Homage is paid to this fearsome
entity by murdering as many non-Rathent as possible. This ensures that
the afterlife will be only moderately painful, rather than an eternity
of anguish and torture.

<P>
Rathent have an irrational attraction to shiny objects, and will often
quarrel over relatively useless objects that glitter.

Ratlings are small humanoid creatures whose head, claws and tail look
like those of a rat. Their legs are also more ratlike than
human. Ratlings have a low life expectancy due to disease resulting from
poor living conditions. Ratlings can speak as well as humans, and
usually speak the local dominant language. Their claws are dexterous
enough to allow a Ratling to use equipment made for humans.

<P>
Ratlings were created by a Grand Mage who later allowed his experiments
to leave his laboratory. In the few years since their creation, the
Ratlings have established themselves amid the slums and backways of the
city.

<P>
The GM may involve Ratlings in the city's political scene if
desired. Examples: The local ruler has placed a bounty on Ratling skins;
Ratlings are active in the Thieves' or Beggars' Guilds; etc.

<P>
The GM may adjust Ratlings to be smaller and more ratlike, if she
likes. Suggested Scale: -5 or less (remember to adjust Offensive and
Defensive Damage Factors).

<P>
Time and time again, necromancers turn to dead humanoids when trying to
inexpensively create tireless, fearless guardians. Corpses are
versatile, readily available, and the once-living bones lend themselves
well to enchantment. A lesser nether-spirit is bound to the dead bones,
animating them and providing a rudimentary, malevolent intelligence. The
resulting creatures need no sustenance, are infinitely patient, and obey
the commands of their creators without question. They are often set to
guard tombs, fortresses, and hiding places of all sorts.

<P>
The Restless Dead appear as piles of old bones scattered around the
places they guard. They have no odor (prior to enchantment, the corpses
are usually stripped of all flesh by being placed onto anthills or in
maggot pits). It takes a Perception roll of Great or above to detect the
thin webwork of sigils covering the bones from any distance.

<P>
When anyone or anything comes near, the bones reassemble into
malevolent, skeletal forms and spring into action.

<P>
Though not terribly strong, the Restless Dead are agile and
tenacious. They are often equipped with rusty, patchwork armor (+1),
shields (+1), and various weapons such as maces, swords, axes, and
spears (+1 to +3).

The wall crawler resembles nothing so much as a nightmarish cross

 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

covered with 6<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.png"
 ALT="$''$"></SPAN> long black spines. The crawler skitters along on sixteen
feet that are equipped with an array of tiny hook-like
protrusions. These allow the creature to travel over almost any
surface. It can traverse a cave ceiling or dungeon wall as easily as it
does the ground.

<P>
Wall crawlers are found in dark places and fill the role of scavengers,
devouring the dead and sometimes the dying.  Wall crawlers rarely attack
living creatures unless in defense or if the creature is badly
injured. They are usually encountered in groups of 7-12 individuals.

<P>
In combat, a wall crawler can deliver a painful bite that sometimes
becomes infected. Its real danger, however, lies in the spines that
cover its body. These spines are sharp and can easily pierce cloth or
the leather sole of a boot.  The hollow spines contain a toxin that
causes confusion and hallucinations. If an adventurer contacts a spine,
he must make a Fair difficulty Health Roll. If he fails the roll, he
will become confused and disoriented within minutes.  For the next 2-4
hours he will be effectively incapacitated by hallucinations, unable to
fight or find his way without assistance.

<P>
Zombies are walking corpses, with shreds of flesh still attached. They
are animated through evil magics (Necromancy, Sorcery, or some evil
Clerical Magic) and obey the instructions of their creators. Zombies
continue to decay, giving them a vile stench and a horrifying
appearance. They may also be disease carriers. The GM may require
characters exposed to zombies to make a Health Roll (Difficulty Level
Mediocre) to avoid contracting some suitably noxious disease.

<P>
Zombies have no initiative, relying on their master for
instructions. Feeling no fear or pain, they make excellent shock
troops. They are almost indestructible, requiring a Near Death result to
``kill'' them.

<P>
Zombies are unable to wield weapons. They attack with their hands and
nails, pummeling their opponents with mindless intensity. They will
attempt to surround and overwhelm difficult opponents.

<P>
Zombies are unintelligent (mindless), and so have no speech, skills,
etc., although they may moan while attacking. They may be repelled with
the Repel Undead Clerical Magic skill (Difficulty Level Mediocre).

<P>
Zombies usually inhabit cemeteries, abandoned churches, necromancers'
strongholds, or temples to evil gods.

<P>
An evil priest, sorcerer, or necromancer can create a Zuvembie by
draining the life force from a man-sized humanoid creature via arcane
magics and poisons. A Zuvembie's flesh becomes hard and its skin
leathery as a result of the process, and Zuvembie bodies do not show the
decay of true zombies. They retain some intelligence, unlike zombies,
and can understand relatively complex instructions. They wield weapons
(albeit clumsily), and may retain some of the skills they maintained in
life, but reduced by 2 levels.

<P>
As with zombies, Zuvembies are immune to pain and require a Near Death
result to ``kill'' them.

<P>
Zuvembies usually inhabit their creators' residence. They may be
Repelled with Great difficulty.
