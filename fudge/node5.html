<H1><A NAME="SECTION00500000000000000000">
Fudge in a Nutshell</A>
</H1>

<P>
Although Fudge is designed to be customized by each Gamemaster, there
are some game design decisions at the core of Fudge that are used by
most Fudge Gamemasters.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00510000000000000000">
Characters and Character Traits</A>
</H1>

<P>
Fudge characters are described by ``traits,'' including attributes (any
trait that everyone in the game world has), skills (any trait that isn't
an attribute and can be improved through practice), gifts (any trait
that isn't an attribute or skill but is something positive for the
character), and faults (any trait that limits a character's actions or
earns him a bad reaction from other people). Supernormal powers are
treated as potent gifts.

<P>
Fudge uses ordinary words to describe some traits, especially attributes
and skills. The following terms of a seven-level sequence are the words
suggested by the Fudge author and used in Grey Ghost Games products:

<P>

<DD>Terrible
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
There is an additional level not listed above: Legendary, which is
beyond Superb. GMs may restrict Legendary traits to non-player
characters.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00520000000000000000">
1 Character Creation</A>
</H1>

<P>
Fudge provides two basic means of creating characters: the ``subjective''
and ``objective'' systems.

<P>
In the subjective system, the player and GM work together to describe
the character in Fudge terms, building from a strong character concept.

<P>
In the objective system, a character's traits start at a default level
(Fair for attributes; Poor for most skills) and the GM grants each
player a number of ``free'' levels to allocate. She may also grant ``free''
gifts, or require one or more faults. The player can then spend two free
levels to raise an attribute from Fair to Great, for instance; or
sacrifice a number of levels to gain a gift, or give his character a
fault in return for levels to apply somewhere else.

<P>
The trading ``values'' of various traits and trait levels are:

<P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1 attribute level =</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">3 skill levels</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1 gift =</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">6 skill levels</TD>

<TD ALIGN="LEFT">2 attribute levels</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1 gift =</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">1 fault</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00530000000000000000">
Scale-- Strength and Mass</A>
</H1>

<P>
Some characters or creatures have certain attributes that are way beyond
the human norm. Prime examples include Strength, Mass, and Speed. Such
attributes are rated in Scale, which acts as a modifier in interactions
between creatures or items of different Scale.

<P>
In a human-based game, Human Scale is 0. A race of greater-than-human
average strength would be Scale +1 Strength or more, while a race of
lesser average strength would be Scale -1 Strength or less. Individuals
are then of Fair or Good Strength, etc., relative to those of their own
Scale.

<P>
In a ``Bunnies'' game, where the player characters are rabbits, Rabbit
Scale would be 0, while Human Scale would likely be +7. In a ``Mecha''
game, where the player characters were giant robots, Mecha Scale would
be 0, while Human Scale would depend on the actual size difference
between the Mechs and humans; a Human Scale of -15 relative to the Mecha
Scale of 0 would not be unreasonable.

<P>
To calculate appropriate Strength/Mass Scale values, figure that each
level of Strength Scale represents an increase of about 1.5 times the
Strength and Mass of the previous Scale level. This is because the Fudge
core rules define each level of Strength (from Terrible to Superb) to be
1.5 times stronger than the previous level. (This progression isn't
necessarily true for other attributes. Superb Dexterity is only about
twice as good as Fair Dexterity, and each level of Speed is 1.2 times
faster than the previous level.) Strength Scale increases at the same
rate: a Scale 1, Fair Strength individual is 1.5 times stronger than a
Scale 0, Fair Strength individual.

<P>
Note that Scale 1 Fair Strength is not exactly equal to a Scale 0 Good
Strength-- Scale really measures Mass, or Density, and affects how
easily a creature may be hurt. A Scale 1 Fair Strength fighter has an
advantage over a Scale 0 Good Strength fighter, even though their
Strengths are equal. The Scale 1 fighter is less affected by the other's
damage due to his greater mass.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00540000000000000000">
3 Action Resolution</A>
</H1>

<P>
For any action the player character wishes to perform, the GM must
determine which trait is tested. (This will usually be a skill or an
attribute.) If the action is Unopposed, the GM determines the Difficulty
Level. Some actions are so easy that the character succeeds
automatically; others are impossible (no rolls needed).

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00550000000000000000">
3.4 Unopposed Actions</A>
</H1>

<P>
When a character performs an action that isn't influenced by anyone
else, it is referred to as an Unopposed action. Examples include jumping
a wide chasm, climbing a cliff, etc.

<P>
Difficulty Level: The GM will set a Difficulty Level when a character
tries an Unopposed Action. Usually the Difficulty Level will be Fair,
but some tasks are easier or harder.

<P>
Rolled Degree: This refers to how well a character does at a particular
task. If someone is Good at Climbing in general, but the die-roll shows
a +1 to the character's skill, then the rolled degree is one level
higher than the character's skill level-- Great, in this case. Rolled
degrees from Superb +1 to Superb +4 are possible; a GM may thus set a
Difficulty Level beyond Superb for nearly impossible actions. Likewise,
there are rolled degrees from Terrible -1 down to Terrible -4. The GM
should use her imagination in determining the consequences of such
abysmal failures.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00560000000000000000">
3.5 Opposed Actions</A>
</H1>

<P>
Actions are Opposed when other people (or animals, etc.) may have an
effect on the outcome of the action. In this case, the player of each
contestant rolls some dice, and the results are compared to determine
the outcome.

<P>
Relative Degree: This refers to how well a character did compared to
another participant in an Opposed Action. The relative degree is
expressed as a number of levels. If a PC gets a rolled degree result of
Good in a fight, and his NPC foe gets a rolled degree result of
Mediocre, the PC beat his foe by two levels-- the relative degree is +2
from his perspective, -2 from hers.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00570000000000000000">
Fudge Dice and Other Random Generators</A>
</H1>

<P>
Fudge dice are six-sided dice with two sides marked + (+1), two sides
marked-- (-1), and two sides left blank (+/-0). Rolling four Fudge dice
(4dF) gives results from -4 (sub-Terrible) to +4 (trans-Superb). To
determine the result of an action, roll the dice; use the result to
modify the trait level being tested. For example, a +3 dice result added
to a Fair trait is a Superb rolled degree; a -1 result added to a Fair
trait indicates a Mediocre result.

<P>
Alternative 3d6 dice method: Roll 3 six-sided dice. Add the numbers and
compare to the following table:

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Determining Wound Levels:</SPAN> Fudge offers many ways to track
combat damage. The Objective Damage System assumes each character will
have an Offensive Damage Factor (the total of modifiers, including any
applicable Strength and Scale bonuses, that reflects the deadliness of
the weapon used) and a Defensive Damage Factor (the total of modifiers,
including Scale and armor, that reflects the character's ability to
withstand or avoid damage). To determine how much damage is done in a
given combat round, the following formula may be used:

<P>
Most characters can withstand three Scratches, one Hurt, and one Very
Hurt. Further Scratches are marked as Hurts, further Hurts are marked as
Very Hurt, etc. For more cinematic games, GMs may adjust the wound
boxes, allowing two Hurts instead of one, for example.

<P>
Fudge games will vary, of course, but many have these simple character
creation and action resolution rules at their core. See Fantasy Fudge,
later in this document, as an example.
