<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>. Action Resolution
</H1> 
<P>
This chapter covers how to determine whether or not a character succeeds
at an attempted action. In the previous chapters, traits were defined in
terms of levels: Superb, Great, Good, etc. This chapter explains how
those levels affect a character's chances of success at an action,
whether fighting a giant or tracking down a clue. Sometimes a Fair
result is sufficient to complete a task, and sometimes a Good or better
result is needed. The better your skill, the better your chances of
getting these higher results.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Dice:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Various options for dice are given: players may use
either three or four six-sided dice (3d6 or 4d6), or two ten-sided dice
as percentile dice (d%), or four Fudge dice (4dF), described in the
text. It is also possible to play Fudge diceless.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Unopposed Action:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>some actions are Unopposed, as when a
character is trying to perform an action which isn't influenced by
anyone else. Examples include jumping a wide chasm, climbing a cliff,
performing a chemistry experiment, etc. The player simply rolls the dice
and reads the result.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Rolled Degree:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>this refers to how well a character does at a
particular task. If someone is Good at Climbing in general, but the
die-roll shows a Great result on a particular attempt, then the rolled
degree is Great.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Difficulty Level:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>the GM will set a Difficulty Level when a
character tries an Unopposed Action. Usually it will be Fair, but some
tasks are easier or harder. Example: climbing an average vertical cliff
face, even one with lots of handholds, is a fairly difficult obstacle
(Fair Difficulty Level). For a very hard cliff, the GM may set the
Difficulty Level at Great: the player must make a rolled degree of Great
or higher to climb the cliff successfully.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Opposed Action:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>actions are Opposed when other people (or
animals, etc.)  may have an effect on the outcome of the action. In this
case, each contestant rolls a set of dice, and the results are compared
to determine the outcome. Examples include combat, seduction attempts,
haggling, tug-of-war, etc.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Relative Degree:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>this refers to how well a character did
compared to another participant in an Opposed Action. Unlike a rolled
degree, relative degree is expressed as a number of levels. For example,
if a PC gets a rolled degree result of Good in a fight, and his NPC foe
gets a rolled degree result of Mediocre, he beat her by two levels--
the relative degree is +2 from his perspective, -2 from hers.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Situational Roll:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>the GM may occasionally want a die roll that
is not based on a character's trait, but on the overall situation or
outside circumstances. This Situational roll is simply a normal Fudge
die roll, but not based on any trait. That is, a result of 0 is a Fair
result, +1 a Good result, -1 a Mediocre result, and so on. This is most
commonly used with Reaction and damage rolls, but can be used elsewhere
as needed. For example, the players ask the GM if there are any
passersby on the street at the moment-- they're worried about
witnesses. The GM decides there are none if a Situational roll gives a
Good or better result, and rolls the dice. (A close approximation to 50%
is an even/odd result: an even result on 4dF occurs 50.6% of the
time. Of course, 1d6 or a coin returns an exact 50% probability.)

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Beyond Superb:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>it is possible to achieve a level of rolled
degree that is beyond Superb. Rolled degrees from Superb +1 to Superb +4
are possible. These levels are only reachable on rare occasions by human
beings. No trait may be taken at (or raised to) a level beyond Superb
(unless the GM is allowing a PC to be at Legendary, which is the same as
Superb +1-- see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node10.html#sec:objectivedevel">5.2</A>, Objective Character
Development). For example, the American baseball player Willie Mays was
a Superb outfielder. His most famous catch, often shown on television,
is a Superb +4 rolled degree. It isn't possible for a human to have that
level of excellence as a routine skill level, however: even Willie was
``just'' a Superb outfielder, who could sometimes do even better. A GM may
set a Difficulty Level beyond Superb for nearly impossible actions.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Below Terrible:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>likewise, there are rolled degrees from
Terrible -1 down to Terrible -4. No Difficulty Level should be set this
low, however: anything requiring a Terrible Difficulty Level or worse
should be automatic for most characters-- no roll needed.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<A NAME="sec:rollingdice"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Rolling the Dice
</H1> 
<P>
There is no need to roll the dice when a character performs an action
that is so easy as to be automatic. Likewise, an action so difficult
that it has no chance to succeed requires no roll, either-- it simply
can't be done. Dice are used solely in the middle ground, where the
outcome of an action is uncertain.

<P>
The GM is encouraged to keep die-rolling to a minimum. Do not make the
players roll the dice when their characters do mundane things. There is
no need to make a roll to see if someone can cook lunch properly, or
pick an item from a shelf, or climb a ladder, etc. Don't even make them
roll to climb a cliff unless it's a difficult cliff or the situation is
stressful, such as a chase. (And possibly a Superb climber wouldn't need
a roll for a difficult cliff. He should get up it automatically unless
it's a very difficult cliff.)

<P>
For any action the player character wishes to perform, the Gamemaster
must determine which trait is tested. (This will usually be a skill or
an attribute.) If the action is Unopposed, the GM also determines the
Difficulty Level-- usually Fair. (See also
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:opposedactions">3.5</A>, Opposed Actions.)

<P>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Reading the Dice: Fudge Dice
</H2> 
<P>
Of the four dice techniques presented in Fudge, this one is
recommended. It gives results from -4 to +4 quickly and easily, without
intruding into role-playing or requiring complex math or a table.

<P>
Fudge dice are six-sided dice with two sides marked +1, two sides marked
-1, and two sides marked 0. They are commercially available from Grey
Ghost Press, Inc.-- see
<A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="http://www.fudgerpg.com"><TT>http://www.fudgerpg.com</TT></A>.

<P>
You can make your own Fudge dice easily enough. Simply get four normal
white d6s. Using a permanent marker, color two sides of each die green,
two sides red, and leave the other two sides white. When the ink has
dried, spray the dice lightly with clear matte finish to prevent the ink
from staining your hands. You now have 4dF: the green sides = +1, the
red sides = -1, and the white sides = 0.

<P>
(While you can try to play with normal d6s-- reading: 1,2 = -1; 3,4 = 0;
5,6 = +1-- this is not recommended. It takes too much effort, and
intrudes into role-playing. 4dF is functionally equivalent to 4d3-8, but
this is also not recommended for the same reason, even if you have d6s
labeled 1-3 twice.)

<P>
To use Fudge dice, simply roll four of them, and total the amount. Since
a +1 and a -1 cancel each other, remove a +1 and -1 from the table, and
the remaining two dice are easy to read no matter what they
are. (Example: if you roll +1, +1, 0, -1, remove the -1 and one of the
+1s, as together they equal 0. The remaining two dice, +1 and 0, are
easily added to +1.) If there is no opposing pair of +1 and -1 dice,
remove any zeros and the remaining dice are again easy to read.

<P>
The result of a die roll is a number between -4 and +4. At the top of
the character sheet, there should be a simple chart of the attribute
levels, such as:

</DD>
</DL>

<P>
To determine the result of an action, simply put your finger on your
trait level, then move it up (for plus results) or down (for minus
results).

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Example: Nathaniel, who has a Good Bow Skill, is shooting in an archery
contest. The player rolls 4dF, using the procedure described above. If
he rolls a 0, he gets a result equal to Nathaniel's skill: Good, in this
case. If he rolls a +1, however, he gets a Great result, since Great is
one level higher than his Good Archery skill. If he rolls a -3, unlucky
Nathaniel has just made a Poor shot.

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It is not always necessary to figure the exact rolled degree. If you
only need to know whether or not a character succeeded at something, it
is usually sufficient for the player simply to announce the appropriate
trait level and the die roll result. The game goes much faster this
way. For example, a player wants his character, Captain Wallop of the
Space Patrol, to fly between two asteroids that are fairly close
together. The GM says this requires a Great Difficulty Level Piloting
roll and asks the player to roll the dice. The player looks up Captain
Wallop's Piloting skill, which is Great, and rolls a +2 result. He
simply announces ``Great +2'' as the result. This answer is
sufficient-- the GM knows that Captain Wallop not only succeeded at the
task, but didn't even come close to damaging his craft.

<P>
Of course, there are many times when you want to know exactly how well
the character did, even if it's not a matter of being close. If the
character is composing a poem, for example, and his Poetry skill is
Fair, you will want to figure out what ``Fair+2'' means: he just wrote a
Great poem! There are many other instances where degrees of success is
more important than merely knowing success/failure.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Other Dice Techniques
</H2> 
<P>
For those who don't want to make or buy Fudge dice, three different
options are available:

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">4d6:</SPAN> this method requires 2d6 of one color (or size) and 2d6 of
another color or size. First declare which two dice are the positive
dice, and which two the negative, then roll all four dice. Do not add
the dice in this system. Instead, remove from the table all but the
lowest die (or dice, if more than one has the same lowest number
showing). If the only dice left on the table are the same color, that is
the result: a positive die with a ``1'' showing is a +1, for example. If
there are still dice of both colors showing, the result is ``0''.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Examples (p = positive die, n = negative die): you roll p4, p3, n3,
n3. The lowest number is a 3, so the p4 is removed, leaving p3, n3 and
n3. Since there are both positive and negative dice remaining, the
result is 0. On another roll, you get p1, p1, n2, n4. Remove the highest
numbers, n2 and n4. This leaves only positive dice, so the result is +1,
since a ``1'' is showing on a positive die, and there are no negative dice
on the table.

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">3d6:</SPAN> Roll 3 six-sided dice. Add the numbers and look up the results on
the table below. The table is so small that it could easily fit on a
character sheet. Example: a roll of 3, 3, 6 is a sum of 12. Looking up
12 on the table yields a result of +1.

<P>
Thus, if your trait is Fair, and the GM says you need a Good result or
better to succeed, you need to roll +1 or better. You'll do this about
two times out of five, on the average.

<P>
You'll notice that using 3d6 or 4d6 the results, while slightly
different, are close enough for a game called Fudge. The 4d6 results do
allow +/-5, however, but this shouldn't be a problem since they occur so
rarely. In fact, you could use 5dF to allow +/-5 if you wanted....

reduce a character's traits.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Examples: Joe, Good with a sword, is Hurt (-1 to all actions). He is
thus only Fair with his sword until he's healed. Jill has Mediocre
Lockpicking skills, but an exceptionally fine set of lock picks gives
her a Fair Lockpicking skill while she's using them.

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If a character has a secondary trait that could contribute significantly
to a task, the GM may allow a +1 bonus if the trait is Good or better.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Example: Verne is at the library, researching an obscure South American
Indian ritual. He uses his Research skill of Good, but he also has a
Good Anthropology skill. The GM decides this is significant enough to
give Verne a Great Research skill for this occasion. If his Anthropology
skill were Superb, the GM could simply let Verne use that instead of
Research: you don't get to be Superb in Anthropology without having done
a lot of research.

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Other conditions may grant a +/-1 to any trait. In Fudge, +/-2 is a
large modifier-- +/-3 is the maximum that should ever be granted except
under extreme conditions.

<A NAME="sec:unopposedactions"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Unopposed Actions
</H1> 
<P>
For each Unopposed action, the GM sets a Difficulty Level (Fair is the
most common) and announces which trait should be rolled against. If no
Skill seems relevant, choose the most appropriate Attribute. If there is
a relevant Skill, but the character is untrained in it (it's not listed
on his character sheet), then use the default: usually Poor. If a high
attribute could logically help an untrained skill, set the default at
Mediocre. For example, a character wishes to palm some coins without
being observed. The GM says to use Sleight of Hand skill, but the
character is untrained in Sleight of Hand. The player points out that
the character's Dexterity attribute is Superb, so the GM allows a
default of Mediocre Sleight of Hand for this attempt.

<P>
The player then rolls against the character's trait level, and tries to
match or surpass the Difficulty Level set by the GM. In cases where
there are degrees of success, the better the roll, the better the
character did; the worse the roll, the worse the character did.

<P>
In setting the Difficulty Level of a task, the GM should remember that
Poor is the default for most skills. The average trained climber can
climb a Fair cliff most of the time, but the average untrained climber
will usually get a Poor result. In the example in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:rollingdice">3.2</A> (Nathaniel shooting at an archery target),
if the target is large and close, even a Mediocre archer could be
expected to hit it: Mediocre Difficulty Level. If it were much smaller
and farther away, perhaps only a Great archer could expect to hit it
regularly: Great Difficulty Level. And so on.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Example of setting Difficulty Level: Two PCs (Mickey and Arnold) and an
NPC guide (Parri) come to a cliff the guide tells them they have to
climb. The GM announces this is a difficult, but not impossible, cliff:
a Good Difficulty Level roll is required to scale it with no delays or
complications. Checking the character sheets, they find that Parri's
Climbing skill is Great and Mickey's is Good. Arnold's character sheet
doesn't list Climbing, so his skill level is at default: Poor. Parri and
Mickey decide to climb it, then lower a rope for Arnold.
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Parri rolls a +1 result: a rolled degree of Superb. She gets up the
cliff without difficulty, and much more quickly than expected. Mickey
rolls a -1, however, for a rolled degree of Fair. Since this is one
level lower than the Difficulty Level, he's having problems. Had Mickey
done Poorly or even Mediocre, he would perhaps have fallen-- or not even
been able to start. Since his rolled degree is only slightly below the
Difficulty Level, though, the GM simply rules he is stuck half way up,
and can't figure out how to go on. Parri ties a rope to a tree at the
top of the cliff, and lowers it for Mickey. The GM says it is now
Difficulty Level: Poor to climb the cliff with the rope in place, and
Mickey makes this easily on another roll.
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Arnold would also need a Poor rolled degree to climb the cliff with the
rope, but since his skill is Poor, they decide not to risk it. Mickey
and Parri have Arnold loop the rope under his arms, and pull him up as
he grabs handholds along the way in case they slip. No roll is needed in
this case, unless they are suddenly attacked when Arnold is only half
way up the cliff....
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>(The whole situation was merely described as an example of setting
Difficulty levels. In actual game play, the GM should describe the
cliff, and ask the players how the characters intend to get up it. If
they came up with the idea of Parri climbing the cliff and lowering a
rope, no rolls would be needed at all-- unless, possibly, time was a
critical factor, or there were hidden difficulties the GM chose not to
reveal because they couldn't have been perceived from the bottom of the
cliff.)

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Occasionally, the GM will roll in secret for the PC. There are times
when even a failed roll would give the player knowledge he wouldn't
otherwise have. These are usually information rolls. For example, if the
GM asks the player to make a roll against Perception attribute (or Find
Hidden Things skill), and the player fails, the character doesn't notice
anything out of the ordinary. But the player now knows that there is
something out of the ordinary that his character didn't notice.... Far
better for the GM to make the roll in secret, and only mention it on a
successful result.

<P>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Opposed Actions
</H1> 
<P>
To resolve an Opposed action between two characters, each side rolls
dice (4dF, d%, 3d6, 4d6, or whatever is your chosen dice technique)
against the appropriate trait and announces the result. The traits
rolled against are not necessarily the same: for example, a seduction
attempt would be rolled against a Seduction skill for the active
participant (or possibly Appearance attribute) and against Will for the
resisting participant. There may be modifiers: someone with a vow of
chastity might get a bonus of +2 to his Will, while someone with a
Lecherous fault would have a penalty-- or not even try to resist.

<P>
The Gamemaster compares the rolled degrees to determine a relative
degree. For example, Lisa is trying to flimflam Joe into thinking she's
from the FBI and rolls a Great result. This is not automatic success,
however. If Joe also rolls a Great result on his trait to avoid being
flimflammed (Knowledge of Police Procedure, Learning, Intelligence,
etc.-- whatever the GM decides is appropriate), then the relative degree
is 0: the status quo is maintained. In this case, Joe remains
unconvinced that Lisa is legitimate. If Joe rolled a Superb result,
Lisa's Great result would have actually earned her a relative degree of
-1: Joe is not going to be fooled this encounter, and will probably even
have a bad reaction to Lisa.

<P>
The Opposed action mechanism can be used to resolve almost any conflict
between two characters. Are two people both grabbing the same item at
the same time? This is an Opposed action based on a Dexterity
attribute-- the winner gets the item. Is one character trying to shove
another one down: Roll Strength vs. Strength (or Wrestling skill) to see
who goes down. Someone trying to hide from a search party: Perception
attribute (or Find Hidden skill) vs. Hide skill (or Camouflage, Stealth,
etc.). Trying to out-drink a rival: Constitution vs. Constitution (or
Drinking skill, Carousing, etc.). And so on.

<P>
Some Opposed actions have a minimum level needed for success. For
example, an attempt to control a person's mind with a Telepathy skill
might require at least a Fair result. If the telepath only gets a
Mediocre result, it doesn't matter if the intended victim rolls a Poor
resistance: the attempt fails. Most combat falls into this category-
see Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node9.html#chap:combat">4</A>.

<P>
For an example of Opposed actions involving more than two characters,
see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node9.html#sec:multiplecombatants">4.34</A>, Multiple Combatants in Melee.

<P>
An Opposed action can also be handled as an Unopposed action. When a PC
is opposing an NPC, have only the player roll, and simply let the NPC's
trait level be the Difficulty Level. This method assumes the NPC will
always roll a 0. This emphasizes the PCs' performance, and reduces the
possibility of an NPC's lucky roll deciding the game.

<P>
As a slight variation on the above, the GM rolls 1dF or 2dF when rolling
for an NPC in an opposed action. This allows some variation in the NPC's
ability, but still puts the emphasis on the PCs' actions.

<P>
For those without Fudge dice, the GM can simply roll 1d6 for an NPC. On
a result of 2-5, the NPC gets the listed trait level as a result. On a
result of 1, the NPC did worse than her trait level; on a result of 6
the NPC did better than her trait level. Those who want to know
precisely how much better or worse should roll a second d6:

<A NAME="sec:criticalresults"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN> Critical Results
</H1> 
<P>
Critical results are an optional Fudge rule for GMs who like the idea. A
natural rolled result of +4 can be considered a critical success-- the
character has done exceptionally well, and the GM may grant some special
bonus to the action. Likewise, a natural result of -4 is a critical
failure, and the character has done as poorly as he possibly can in the
given situation.

<P>
Note that achieving +/-4 with die modifiers does not count as a critical
result, though the character has done exceptionally well or poorly. When
a natural critical result is rolled, the GM may ignore what the rolled
degree would be, and treat it as an automatic beyond Superb or below
Terrible result.

<P>
Optionally, if a character gets a rolled degree four or more levels
better than the Difficulty Level, he has gotten a critical
success. Likewise, four levels below a Difficulty Level is a critical
failure.

<P>
A critical result in combat can mean many things: one fighter falls
down, or drops his weapon, or is hurt extra badly, or is stunned for a
round and can't even defend himself, or is temporarily blinded, or
knocked out, etc. The GM should be creative, but not kill a character
outright.

<P>
The GM may even wish to make a table, such as these sample melee
critical results:

<P>
Roll 2d6:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">2</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=216>Blinded for the next combat round-- no defense or offense!</TD>

</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">9</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=216>...</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
And so on-- finish and customize to your tastes.

<P>
This is an easy way to achieve a lot of detail without complicating
Fudge. Those with Internet access are invited to add any interesting
critical results tables they create to the Fudge sites.

<A NAME="sec:npcreactions"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN> NPC Reactions
</H1> 
<P>
Sometimes a non-player character has a set reaction to the PCs. Perhaps
she's automatically their enemy, or perhaps the party has rescued her,
and earned her gratitude. But there will be many NPCs that don't have a
set reaction. When the PCs request information or aid, it might go
smoothly or it might not go well at all. Negotiation with a stranger is
always an unknown quantity to the players-- it may be so for the GM,
too.

<P>
When in doubt, the GM should secretly make a Situational roll. If the PC
in question has a trait that can affect a stranger's reaction, this
should grant a +/-1 (or more) to the result. Examples include Appearance
(which could be an attribute, gift or fault), Charisma, Reputation,
Status, and such habits as nose-picking or vulgar language. The Reaction
roll can also be modified up or down by circumstances: bribes,
suspicious or friendly nature of the NPC, proximity of the NPC's boss,
observed PC behavior, etc.

<P>
The higher the Reaction roll result, the better the reaction. On a Fair
result, for example, the NPC will be mildly helpful, but only if it's
not too much effort. She won't be helpful at all on Mediocre or worse
results, but will react well on a Good result or better.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Example: Nathaniel needs some information about the local duke, who he
suspects is corrupt. He has observed that folks are reticent to talk
about the duke to strangers. Nathaniel decides to approach a talkative
vegetable seller at the open market. Nathaniel has an average appearance
(no modifier), but is charismatic: +1 to any Reaction roll. He makes
small talk for a while, then slowly brings the duke into the
conversation. The GM decides this was done skillfully enough to warrant
another +1 on the reaction roll. However, the situation is prickly: -2
in general to elicit any information about the sinister local
ruler. This cancels Nathaniel's bonuses. The GM rolls in secret, and
gets a Fair result. The old lady slips out a bit of useful information
before realizing what she's just said. At that point she clams up, but
Nathaniel casually changes the subject to the weather, dispelling her
suspicions. He wanders off to try his luck elsewhere.
