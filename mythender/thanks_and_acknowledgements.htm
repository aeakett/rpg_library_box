<h2><span class="bigger">T</span>HANKS <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="bigger">B</span>LAME</h2>

<p>I blame Leonard Balsera.</p>

<p>Back in Autumn of 2007, when I was struggling on another design long since abandoned, Lenny said to me, “Dude, take a break and make a game about killing orcs or something.”</p>

<p>“Eh, if I’m going to do that I’d rather start big, like killing dragons,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Whatever, just go cleanse your palette and get back to your other game.”</p>

<p>That conversation led to this, my most ambitious idea to date, and I have Lenny to blame for that. Oh, and I never did get back to that other game. Turns out Paul Tevis did a better version of that game with <em>A Penny For My Thoughts</em>, on which I would later work with him.</p>

<p>Finally, a massive thank-you to my editor, Josh Roby. He pointed out a host of bullshit in the Random Kindness Encounter edition of the book, including organization and numerous language issues. You should hire the fuck out of him. He’s brilliant. (<strong>joshroby.com</strong>)</p>

<h3>Debts Owed</h3>

<p>Every movie that has had a grand battle scene influenced <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>. Chief among them: <em>300</em>,<em> Beowulf</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children</em>, <em>The Two Towers</em>, and <em>Return of the King</em>.</p>

This game also owes a debt to the big set-piece role-playing games, namely <em>Dungeons &mp; Dragons</em>. And this game’s high concept wouldn’t have happened without <em>Nobilis</em> by Jenna Moran. Mythenders are a twist on <em>Nobilis</em>’ Excrucians, making them the center of the story.</p>

<p>Some other games that were influential: John Harper’s <em>Agon</em>, Christian Griffen’s <em>Beast Hunters</em>, Fred Hicks’s <em>Don’t Rest Your Head</em>, and White Wolf’s <em>Exalted</em>. I’m certain there are many that subtly influenced me over the years that I’m not listing here, so I hope you’ll indulge a blanket thank-you to the various RPG creative communities out there.</p>

<p>I believe it was Josh Hoade who gave me the tagline “Kick Ass, Erase Names.” That was a focus, a catalyst, for the tone I’ve taken this text and game.</p>

<p>My home playtest squad—Aaron, Jerry, and Mike—built a story with this game that still surprises me. This game would be an empty shell if not for that campaign.</p>

<p>Finally, I personally owe a great debt to all my great playtesters and people who have let me bounce ideas off of them or gave me feedback over the years. And I owe a debt to my comrades in the Evil Hat family for forging me into the game designer and developer I am today. This is not a game I could have made when I started; I only can now because of you all.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>—Ryan Macklin</p>

<h3>A Few Memories</h3>
<p>I won’t go into many—I can’t, for I haven’t the space—but there are some special moments in playtesting that I want to give personal thanks to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Joe:Iwillnotforgetthatangelicfiddle,norwillIforgettheline“Myactionisthat I die and am reborn. That hurts the Myth, right?” (For the record, that still does.)
<li><strong>Jerry:</strong> what you do to horses is insane.</li>
<li><strong>Shawn:</strong> you showed me how awesome dynastic character creation can be.</li>
<li><strong>David:</strong> the moment where you held the mortal and apologized for existing still moves me today.</li>
<li><strong>Andrew:</strong> you got away with it once. Don’t push your luck.</li>
<li><strong>Brendan:</strong> you’re the reason the Child is a playable option.</li>
<li><strong>Lillian &amp; Nora:</strong> you two made Murder totally rad.</li>
<li><strong>Fred:</strong> your love for Cthulhu is like a rock, Berserker.</li>
<li><strong>John &mp; Sage:</strong> your race to apotheosis was&hellpi;enlightening.</li>
<li><strong>Rob:</strong> I cannot thank you enough for breaking my game as viciously as you did.</li>
<li><strong>E:</strong> BEES!</li>
<li><strong>Andrew, Angela, Nate, Wil:</strong> ho ho ho, motherfuckers.</li>
</ul></p>
