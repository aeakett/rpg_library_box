<p><span class="gameKeyword">Gifts</span> are the abilities that your Mythic Heart grants you as you slide closer and closer to Mythic oblivion. They allow you to change the rules of battle.</p>

<p>Most Gifts cost Might tokens to trigger them, which you can gain through draining the <span class="gameKeyword">+2 Might</span> Weapon charge box, doing Titanic actions, or Terrorizing Mortals for Power. Some also require you to incorporate some description into your narrative, though if what you’ve described already involves that, you don’t need to go further.</p>

<p>Every Mythender begins with one Gift at character creation, specified by the Heart taken. Myths also have a number of Gifts: three to five for Lesser Myths and as many as ten for Greater Myths (counting upgrades).</p>

<h3>Gaining New Gifts</h3>

<p>As new Fate boxes are checked, the Gift slots next to them become unlocked. If you have an empty Gift slot, you may fill it in <em>at any time</em> with a new Gift or upgrade, interrupting whatever you’re doing at that moment. You may use that Gift right away, provided you can pay the Might cost and it’s something you can use in that moment.</p>

<p><em><strong>Example: Yolen rolls for his action, and gets a number of failures. He has an empty Gift slot, and wants to get more out of his roll. He could take the <span class="gameKeyword">Relentlessness</span> Gift (<a href="#">page 166</a>), that allows rerolling failed dice. He could also take the <span class="gameKeyword">Sureness</span> Gift (<a href="#">page 166</a>), which allows dice of <span class="stormDie">3</span> or higher to be successes, but because that’s done before the roll, he couldn’t use it on this turn.</strong></em></p>

<h3>Losing Gifts</h3>

<p>If you <a href="#">Seek Sympathy &amp; Healing</a> (pages 174 and 196), you can choose to reduce the Fate boxes checked. If you do, you lose the Gift slots associated with those Fate boxes. Erase the Gifts in those boxes, if any. (Because you cannot reduce your permanent Fate boxes, any Gifts in those locations are permanent as well.)</p>

<p>If you progress your Fate further in the future, you may choose the same of different Gifts for those reopened slots.</p>

<p>Mythenders also lose any Gifts associated with non-permanent Fate box when the adventure is over and a new one begins (<a href="#">page 65</a>).</p>

<h3>Base Gifts &amp; Upgrades</h3>

<p>The list (pages 164–167) details all the Gifts. Each one has a basic option, and many come with upgrades. These upgrades may be taken whenever you fill in a new Gift slot, improving a Gift you already have. You may only take a Gift or upgrade once, unless otherwise stated. When choosing an upgrade, you may choose any of those listed. They aren’t sequential upgrade trees or anything like that.</p>

<h4>Changing Might Costs</h4>

<p>Upgrades that change Might costs (explicitly stating “more” or “fewer”) are cumulative. Any that state an absolute amount to pay, not more or fewer, are separate costs. No Gift costs fewer than 0 Might tokens.</p>

<h3>Once Per Action</h3>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, each Gift can only be used once per action, though multiple different Gifts can be used in a single action. (The <span class="gameKeyword">Swiftness</span> Gift may be used only once per round.)</p>

<h4>Aiding Upgrades</h4>

<p>Some Gifts have an <span class="gameKeyword">Aiding</span> upgrade, which allows a Mythender to use their Gift for someone else. This counts as using that Gift this action; if they also have the same Gift, only one of you can use it at the moment.</p>

<h3>Action Restrictions on Gifts</h3>

<p>Some Gifts have restrictions on the actions they work for, such as saying a Gift only normally works for Legendary and Mythic actions. If these Gifts are available to the Myth, it has no such restrictions, since it doesn’t have a scale of action.</p>

<h3>Myth-only &amp; Mythender-only Gifts</h3>

<p>Most Gifts are available to both sides. But some are only available to Mythenders, and some are only available to Myths. These are noted as such.</p>

<h3>Non-Action Gifts</h3>

<p>While most Gifts involve modifying an action (such as the die pool roll or the Wound, whether it’s your action or you’re the target of another’s action), there are a couple that just provide an immediate effect upon taking it and don’t do anything after that: <span class="gameKeyword">Channeled Hatred</span> and <span class="gameKeyword">Surge of Might</span>. These remain on your list of Gifts once taken, but do not provide benefit to future actions.</p>

<p>The Myth-only Gift <span class="gameKeyword">Building Doom</span> is a non-action Gift that provides a continual benefit.</p>

   <h3>Blaze of Glory</h3>
   <p class="giftQual">Mythenders only</p>
   <p>Whenever you roll the <span class="gameKeyword">Mythic die</span> in Battle, roll a second Mythic die and combine the results. This costs no Might. If you have this Gift, you <em>must</em> do this.</p>
   <p>This is considered a single die for the purposes of risking your Fate, so you’re almost guaranteed to progress your Fate, as you’ll rarely get a result lower than 4.</p>

<h3>Bloodlust</h3>
<p>Pay <span class="gameKeyword">2 Might tokens</span> when you’re Wounded and have lost Thunder dice. Gain Lightning tokens equal to the Thunder dice lost.</p>
<p>If a Mythender dies and comes back, all the Thunder dice lost before coming back count for this Gift.</p>
