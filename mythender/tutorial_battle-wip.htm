<h2><span class="bigger">H</span>OW <span class="amp">&amp; <span class="bigger">W</span>HEN TO <span class="bigger">U</span>SE THIS <span class="bigger">T</span>UTORIAL</h2>

<p>This tutorial battle will teach you how all of the pieces and parts work in <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Charging and draining Weapons and Blights</li>
   <li>Creating, using, and destroying Blights</li>
   <li>Wounding your foes</li>
   <li>Gathering power and Corruption</li>
</ul>
<p>Anytime you have even one player who has never played <span class="mythender">Mythender</span>, use this tutorial for the first battle. Start off your Mythmaster turn as this battle.</p>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<p>You all should have a Mythender playsheet in front of you (or in the case of the Mythmaster, a Myth playsheet) as well as some Blight cards. <span class="mythender">Mythender</span> is nearly impossible to play without them (though making a Myth playsheet and Blight cards on the fly isn’t too difficult).</p>

<p>The Mythmaster will direct everyone through this tutorial. It will be very helpful if everyone has a copy of this chapter, but that’s not strictly necessary. Ideally, the Mythmaster has read the actual Battle chapter and, well, the rest of the book.</p>

<h3>Physical Tokens</h3>

<p>You’re using physical tokens for everything, right? A bunch of Storm dice (<span class="stormDie">6</span>), Thunder dice (<span class="thunderDie">6</span>), and bonus Thunder dice (<span class="bonusDie">6</span>) within reach of everyone? And at least one Mythic die (<span class="mythicDie">6</span>) on hand? Two kinds of tokens for Lightning and Might?</p>

<p>Mythender battles are tactile experiences. Not using them makes the baby Odin smile with joy, and we certainly don’t want that, do we?</p>

<h3>Using this Tutorial</h3>

<p>The text is addressed to the Mythmaster, so when you see “you,” that’s who we’re talking to. Of course, everyone is more than welcome to read and follow along. The text just assumes as a base idea that the Mythmaster is reading and the players are following verbal directions.</p>

<p>This is split up to distribute the rules in easy-to-learn chunks, starting with the foundations and moving up.</p>

<h4>When to Do Something</h4>

<p class="tutAct"><span class="gameKeyword">Everyone</span>: when the font looks like this, the Mythmaster or a player is directed to do
something. Okay, except for this time. This is just an example.</p>

<h4>When to Read Verbatim</h4>

<p class="readAloud">When the font looks like this, read it as-is to the players. Each section will be flagged to read, demonstrated below.</p>

<p class="readAloud">If something is in [Brackets], it means fill that part in with the appropriate bit.</p>

<p>Other text can be paraphrased. The point of the verbatim text is to also convey a larger than life tone while being a little tongue-in-cheek. If that’s not your style, change the text to suit. But if you do, <strong>tell the same information and convey the same sense of grandeur and challenge in your tone</strong>.</p>

<h4>Going Off-Script</h4>

<p>This chapter is written to help those who are comfortable reading from a book and haven’t spent a lot of time learning this game. Some people really hate reading from a book, and if you’re one of those people, please try it anyway for the sake of learning and teaching the group. This game has a complex economy and it helps to introduce rules in chunks.</p>

<h3>Special Rules for the Tutorial</h3>

<p class="tutAct"><span class="gameKeyword">Mythmaster</span>: read the following to the table.</p>

<p class="readAloud">Because this tutorial is designed to introduce concepts in layers, we’re going to ignore some of the rules during different parts of it. If a rule hasn’t been mentioned yet, then it’s not applicable right now. After this battle, all rules are fair game.</p>

<p class="readAloud">Sometimes I’ll cheat, in order to make the tutorial work with fickle dice. I’ll point that out every time I do so.</p>

<p class="readAloud">It’s cool to ask questions about what’s going on and what’s on the playsheet. But I might respond with “We’ll get to that in a bit” if the rule’s about to be covered later.</p>

<p class="tutAct"><span class="gameKeyword">Mythmaster</span>: when the players ask a question that’s not covered in the current step, let
them know that you’ll get to it later.</p>

<h3>What the Mythmaster Need to Keep in Mind</h3>

<p>Your biggest job involves keeping tone and scale consistent. This is why you Push Forward on most of the early actions in battle: you set the tone for what should be narrated and what is and isn’t right for a given scale of action.</p>

<h3>What Rules Aren’t Covered in this Tutorial</h3>

<p>Most of the rules are covered in this tutorial, but not all of them. There are prelude actions, which is a way for one Mythender to go before the Myth in battle. Doubling down on a Wound can be resisted, though it costs your foe Lightning tokens to do so. And there are many Gifts that manipulate how battle works for you. Also, Murder isn’t covered by this tutorial, as that’s a major distraction to learning how battle works.</p>

<p>At this point, you have enough experience with battle to pick up on the various tricks and rules as you read through the Battle chapter and the list of Gifts.</p>

<h3>The Bare Minimum Knowledge</h3>

<p>Ideally, the Mythmaster has taken some time to digest this book, but we don’t live in an ideal world. If you’re trying to get a jump into playing Mythender sooner, at least skim the <a href="#">What is Mythender?</a>, <a href="#">What You Need to Play</a>, and <a href="#">Creating Your Mythender</a> chapters so you have a sense of the game’s scope, as well as the <a href="#">Battling Myths &amp; Gods<a/> chapter—<a href="#">especially pages 114–117</a>. The tutorial might be rocky with just a skim, but at least you can try it. And after you do, you and the rest of the group will have actual play context to draw from while reading this book.</p>

<h2><span class="bigger">T</span>UTORIAL <span class="bigger">B</span>ATTLE <span class="bigger">O</span>VERVIEW</h2>

<p><a href="#">Setup</a><br>
Where everyone will gather dice and tokens for the start of the battle.</p>

<p><a href="#">Myth’s First Action</a><br>
The Myth starts off each battle. The Mythmaster will show charging a Weapon and overall flow of an action.</p>

<p><a href="#">Mythenders’ First Actions</a><br>
The Mythenders take Legendary actions to start with, and will charge a Weapon and practice the overall flow of action. The Mythmaster will Push Forward.</p>

<p><a href="#">Myth’s Second Action</a><br>
The Myth will charge a Weapon again, and also create a Blight.</p>

<p><a href="#">Mythenders’ Second Actions</a><br>
The Mythenders take Mythic actions this time, charging a Weapon and using the Mythic die. They’ll also create and charge Blights.</p>

<p><a href="#">Suffering Corruption</a><br>
When Mythenders use the Mythic die, they suffer Corruption.</p>

<p><a href="#">Myth’s Third Action</a><br>
The Myth will drain the Weapon and Wound the Mythenders.</p>

<p><a href="#">Wounding the Mythenders</a><br>
This describes what happens when Mythenders are Wounded.</p>

<p><a href="#">Dead Mythenders</a><br>
Should a Mythender run out of Thunder dice due to being Wounded, this covers what happens, and how a Mythender comes back from death.</p>

<p><a href="#">The Mythenders’ Third Round</a><br>
The third round is a bit more complicated in this tutorial, as the Mythmaster needs to introduce new rules in a sequence: Draining, Titanic actions, and Wounding.</p>

<p><a href="#">Mythenders’ Third Action: Mythic/Draining</a><br>
Some Mythenders will do another Mythic action, and also possibly drain the Blight they’ve been charging.</p>

<p><a href="#">Mythenders’ Third Action: Titanic</a><br>
Some Mythenders will do a Titanic action, generating much more Lightning at the cost of inflicting self-harm.</p>

<p><a href="#">Wounding the Myth</a><br>
This describes what happens when Myth is Wounded.</p>

<p><a href="#">Battle Epilogue</a><br>
The battle is over! Time for the epilogue.</p>

<h2><span class="bigger">A</span>DVICE <span class="bigger">F</span>ROM <span class="bigger">O</span>THERS ON THE <span class="bigger">T</span>UTORIAL</h2>

<p>Many other people have run the tutorial. Here’s some advice</p>

<p>“It’s really easy to go off-script when running the tutorial battle. Of the two times I’ve ran it, it definitely went smoother when I stuck closer to the script. There’s so many moving pieces, if you don’t follow the script it’s easy to get lost. So, I’d say that even though it can feel a little forced to follow the script exactly, do so. It makes a difference.” —Jeremiah Frye</p>

<p>“If the players are unused to the notion of narrative control and are instead accustomed to rolling to see if they succeed, remind them they <em>will</em> succeed, and the die roll just helps describe <em>how</em> well. ‘Do, or do not; there is no try.’</p>

<p>“Remind them there is no defense. There is no escape. The only way to succeed is to act before they are killed.</p>

<p>“If the players get comfortable with the notion of extreme physical violence, remind them that Myth is also metaphysical. The Mythenders each have an emotional basis for their origins. You can demonstrated this by having the Myth strikes them at that very emotional core.” —Robert Calfee</p>

<p>“Go big or go extinct. You need to get the players to hammer home with creative, epic ideas. It’s a one-shot, so you really don’t need to show any care or restraint in terms of escalation. Feel free to let it get ridiculous, and encourage each stunt to top previous stunts. The first time I ever played Mythender, one of the Mythenders used a dark and brooding presence to start pulling the Moon down to Norden. We then used that Moon to smash a hole all the way through the center of the world, and then had a fight in that tunnel. Thor wound up smashed between the walls of the world-hole.</p>

<p>“Describe the battlefield in its ongoing state. The Mythenders, even if they’re not creating Blights, are still affecting the landscape. Remind them of the details of the battlefield, and help them draw a vivid picture of what’s going on and where. If they’re looking for ideas, toss in suggestions such as ‘Well, half of the mountain’s lying at your feet in big, granite-y chunks; maybe you could do something with that?’” —Andy Hauge</p>

<p>“I don’t have poker chips handy, but I do have a change dish. What I did when I ran the tutorial battle was use pennies for Lightning tokens and quarters for Might tokens. (I also used nickels as 5&times; Lightning tokens when I ran low on pennies.) The game is definitely a tactile experience. I felt the small nature of pennies contrasted well with the relatively heavy quarters. I’d suggest having a physical texture or weight difference between the Lightning tokens and Might tokens to emphasize how weighty Might is—opposed to simply red poker chips for one and blue chips for the other, where you can’t feel the difference. When you spend Might, you’re doing something no mortal could ever accomplish. It may help new players grasp that if their game tokens convey that same feeling.</p>

<p>“Also, this shouldn’t really need to be said, but you should not let the Mythenders Murder each other during the tutorial. It sounds so obvious but it might be worth foot noting as a ‘don’t be a dick,’ at least not during the tutorial. New players probably won’t even know it’s possible, but you know, just in case.” —Michael Gray Thompson</p>

<h2><span class="bigger">S</span>ETUP</h2>

For this tutorial, you’ll need a Myth playsheet for the einherjar (page 212).
The First Thing in the Adventure
This tutorial assumes that the Mythmaster is starting in the adventure with this battle, and
that the Mythenders have not had any other moments yet. If you deviate from this, all of the
numbers will be off, due to the Mythenders possibly having gained Corruption and Fate.
Gathering Dice & Tokens
Each Mythender should gather 3 Storm dice (6) and put them in the top-left corner of
their playsheets, the one labeled Storm Dice. Then they gather 1 Thunder die (6) and
put it in the bottom-left corner of their playsheets, labeled Thunder Dice. They leave the
bottom-right corner, Lightning Tokens, empty. Finally, they each should have 5 Might
tokens in the top-right corner, labeled Might Tokens.
If any of them has the Harbinger of Storm Gift, they take 5 Storm dice instead of 3.
Mythmaster: if any of the Mythenders has the “Harbinger of Storm” gift, read the
following to the table.
You probably notice that some of you have a Storm Rating of 3, and others a Storm Rating
of 5. This is because of your Gifts. We won’t get into this in any detail right away, but Gifts
change some of the battle rules for your Mythender. The “Harbinger of Storm” Gift gives
you two more Storm. The other ones you have let you do different things, by spending
those Might tokens you have.
I’ll explain what those other Gifts do later. For now, we’ll focus on the basic rules. But
know that Gifts are key to bringing the Myth down. The Myth also has some Gifts, which
I won’t use right away.
Mythmaster: if no one has the “Harbinger of Storm” gift, read the following to the table.
You’ll see a couple things called Gifts and Might on your playsheet. They’re your special
ways of changing how the battle rules work for you. We’ll get into how they work later. But
know that they’re key to bringing the Myth down. The Myth also has some Gifts, which I
won’t use right away.
Then gather the 4 Storm dice, 2 Thunder dice, and 6 Might tokens that the einherjar have
for yourself.
