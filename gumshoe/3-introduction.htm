It naturally assumes that you have acquired a fundamental understanding of GUMSHOE by reading and extensively playing at least one GUMSHOE game. When creating core rule books, you will want to interleave this text with examples of your own devising, which show new readers how the rules work, and, at the same time, convey the tone, spirit and entertainment value of your setting.</p><p class="s2 c2">This open license document does not grant rights to use the settings of Pelgrane’s GUMSHOE games. You might however use it as the basis for generic scenarios GMs can adapt to their horror, space opera, or spy thriller GUMSHOE worlds of choice.</p></div></body></html>
