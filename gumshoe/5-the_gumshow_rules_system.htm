But first bear with us for a little explanatory theory.</p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh1"/><span id="b68"/>Why This Game Exists</h2><p class="s2 c2">GUMSHOE speeds and streamlines the time-honored form of the investigative roleplaying game. The central question a traditional RPG asks is:</p><p class="s2 c2">Will the heroes get the information they need?</p><p class="s2 c2">Assuming that they look in the right place and apply appropriate abilities to the task, GUMSHOE ensures that the heroes get the basic clues they need to move through the story. The question it asks is:</p><p class="s2 c2">What will the heroes do with the information once they’ve got it?</p><p class="s2 c2">If you think about it, this is how the source materials we base our mystery scenarios on handle clues. You don’t see the forensic techies on CSI failing to successfully use their lab equipment, or Sherlock Holmes stymied and unable to move forward because he blew his Zoology roll.</p><p class="s2 c2">You don’t see this because, in a story failure to gain information is rarely more interesting than getting it. New information opens up new narrative possibilities, new choices and actions for the characters. Failure to get information is a null result that takes you nowhere.</p><p class="s2 c2">In a fictional procedural, whether it’s a mystery novel or an episode of a cop show, the emphasis isn’t on finding the clues in the first place. When it really matters, you may get a paragraph telling you how difficult the search was, or a montage of a CSI team tossing an apartment. But the action really starts after the clues are gathered.</p><p class="s2 c2">Investigative scenarios are not about finding clues, they’re about interpreting the clues you do find.</p><p class="s2 c2">GUMSHOE, therefore, makes the finding of clues all but automatic, as long as you get to the right place in the story and have the right ability. That’s when the fun part begins, when the players try to put the components of the puzzle together.</p><p class="s2 c2">That’s hard enough for a group of armchair detectives, without withholding half the pieces from them. Every investigative scenario begins with a crime or conspiracy committed by a group of antagonists. The bad guys do something bad. The player characters must figure out who did it and put a stop to their activities.</p><p class="s2 c2">When you do see information withheld from characters, it’s seldom portrayed as a failure on the part of the competent, fact-gathering heroes. Instead the writers show an external force preventing them from applying their abilities. In a space opera show, you might get the proverbial ion storm that prevents the crew from scanning the planet before they go down. Information is only withheld when it makes the story more interesting—usually by placing the heroes at a handicap while they move forward in the storyline. In GUMSHOE terms, they’re not trying to get an available clue and failing; they’re using an ability for which no clue is available.</p><p class="s2 c2">Historically, story-based roleplaying, of which investigative games were an early if not the earliest example, evolved from dungeon-bashing campaigns. They treat clues the same way that dungeon games treat treasure. You have to search for the clue that takes you on to the next scene. If you roll well, you get the clue. If not, you don’t—and the story grinds to a halt.</p><p class="s2 c2">However, treasure gathering isn’t the main event in a dungeon game. There, the central activity is killing the monsters and enemies who live in the dungeon. The treasure-finding phase comes afterwards, as a mere reward. If you don’t get all the treasure in a room, you lose out a bit, but the story keeps going, as you tromp down the hallway to the next monster-filled chamber.</p><p class="s2 c2">Imagine a dungeon game where you always had to roll well to find another room to plunder, or sit around feeling frustrated and bored.</p><p class="s2 c2">Many of our favorite roleplaying games use the traditional roll-to-get-a-clue model. You may have been lucky enough to play in them without ever seeing your game ground to a halt after a failed information roll. Perhaps your GM, or the scenario designer, has carefully crafted the adventure so that you never have to get any specific clue to advance the story.</p><p class="s2 c2">More likely, your GM adjusts on the fly to your failed rolls, creating elaborate workarounds that get you the same information by different means. When you think about it, these runarounds moments are essentially time killers. They bring about a predetermined, necessary result while giving you the illusion of randomness and chance. GUMSHOE cuts out these filler moments in favor of scenes that actually advance the story. With the time saved, you can construct more detailed, compelling mysteries for the players to sort out. That’s where the streamlining comes in.</p><p class="s2 c2">If you’ve never had a game stop dead on a missed clue, you may naturally figure that it never happens to anyone. Having run GMing seminars at conventions for years, I can assure you that this is not the case. People come up to me all the time to share their horror stories of games that literally go nowhere on a blown spot test. This should not be surprising. GMs are doing what the rules tell them to do, and failing to see the unwritten rule that they should then spend five to twenty minutes of game time introducing a workaround.</p><p class="s2 c2">GUMSHOE gives you the rules you should actually use as written, and skips the workaround.</p><p class="s2 c2">But even if you’ve never noticed this problem, play it because it focuses and streamlines play, eliminating the elaborate workarounds your GM has to use to make the missed information rolls invisible to you. It replaces these moments of circular plotting with more interesting scenes that move the story forward.</p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh2"/><span id="b69"/>Mystery Structure</h2><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[Alter as needed for your genre.]</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Every investigative scenario begins with a crime, conspiracy, or other act of disorder committed by a group of antagonists. The bad guys do something bad. The player characters must figure out who did it and put a stop to their activities.</p><p class="s2 c2">Your GM designs each scenario by creating an investigation trigger, a sinister conspiracy, and a trail of clues.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">The investigation trigger. </span><span class="c1">This is the event, that attracts the attention of investigators.</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c25">•</span><span class="c5">The discovery of a murder victim, obviously slain during a ritualistic killing.</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c25">•</span><span class="c5">The discovery of a corpse slain by supernatural means, perhaps by a creature.</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c25">•</span><span class="c5">Sightings of supernatural creatures or phenomena.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">The sinister conspiracy. </span><span class="c1">This sets out who the bad guys are, what they’ve done so far, what they’re trying to do, and how the investigation trigger fits into the overall scheme. The GM also determines what has to happen to prevent the plot from going forward. This, unknown to the players, is their victory condition — what they have to do to thwart the bad guys and bring the story to a positive conclusion.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">Once the GM has the logic of the story worked out from the villain’s point of view, she then thinks in reverse, designing a </span><span class="c6">trail of clues </span><span class="c1">leading from the investigation trigger to an understanding of the sinister plot and its players, sufficient to get to work destroying it.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">Optionally, the GM may also plan a series of </span><span class="c6">antagonist reactions</span><span class="c1">. These lay out what the bad guys do when they find out that they’re being investigated. The GM determines what conditions trigger them, and what the antagonists attempt to do. These may include further crimes, giving the team more to investigate. They may try to destroy evidence, hinder the investigation by planting false leads, or to intimidate or dispose of potential witnesses, including accomplices they no longer trust. They may attack the investigators. Foolish, overconfident or risk-taking antagonists may take them on directly. Clever antagonists will strike from a distance, taking great pains to cover their tracks.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Ordinary crime dramas may call for a simpler structure. The bad guys could still be furthering a sinister plot, or they may be doing nothing after committing the triggering crime other than hoping that the investigators don’t catch up with them. In this case there is no ongoing conspiracy to disrupt. To achieve victory and bring the scenario to a successful conclusion, the investigators need merely prove their case against the criminals. The climactic scene might involve wringing a confession from the wrongdoer, or provoking him into revealing the crucial bit of evidence which will ensure his conviction.</p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh3"/><span id="b70"/>From Structure To Story</h2><p class="s2 c2">The GM’s structure notes are not a story. The story occurs as you, the team of players, brings the structure to life through the actions of your characters. The story proceeds from scene to scene, where you determine the pace, discovering clues and putting them together. Your characters interact with locations, gathering physical evidence, and supporting characters run by the GM, gathering expert and eyewitness testimony.</p><p class="s2 c2">The first scene presents the mystery you have to solve. You then perform legwork, collecting information that tells you more about the case. Each scene contains information pointing to a new scene. Certain scenes may put a new twist on the investigation, as the initial mystery turns out to be just one aspect of a much bigger story. As clues accumulate, a picture of the case emerges, until your characters arrive at a climactic scene, where all is revealed and the bad guys confronted. A wrap-up scene accounts for loose ends and shows the consequences of your success—or, in rare instances, failure. (Why is failure possible at all? Its possibility creates urgency and suspense.)</p><p class="s2 c2">To move from scene to scene, and to solve the overall mystery, you must gather clues. They fuel your forward momentum.</p><p class="s2 s5 c2">[[[BEGIN SIDEBAR]]]</p><h4 class="c2">Tip For Players: Containing Speculation</h4><p class="s2"><span class="c1">Investigative scenarios often bog down into speculative debate between players about what </span><span class="c5">could be</span><span class="c1"> happening. Many things </span><span class="c5">can</span><span class="c1"> be happening, but only one thing </span><span class="c5">is</span><span class="c1">. If more than one possible explanation ties together the clues you have so far, you need more clues.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">Whenever you get stuck, </span><span class="c6">get out and gather more information</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="s2 s5 c2">[[[END SIDEBAR]]]</p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh4"/><span id="b71"/>Gathering Clues</h2><p class="s2 c2">Gathering clues is simple. All you have to do is: 1) get yourself into a scene where relevant information can be gathered and 2) have the right ability to discover the clue and 3) tell the GM that you’re using it. As long as you do these three things, you will never fail to gain a piece of necessary information. It is never dependent on a die roll. If you ask for it, you will get it.</p><p class="s2 c2">You can specify exactly what you intend to achieve: “I use Textual Analysis to determine if the memo was really written by Danziger.”</p><p class="s2 c2">Or you can engage in a more general informational fishing expedition: “I use Evidence Collection to search the crime scene.”</p><p class="s2 c2">If your suggested action corresponds to a clue in the scenario notes, the GM provides you the information arising from the clue.</p><p class="s2"><span id="b72"/><span class="c1">Some clues would be obvious to a trained investigator immediately upon entering a scene. These passive clues are provided by the GM without prompting. Scenarios suggest which clues are passive and which are active, but your GM will adjust these in play depending on how much guidance you seem to need. On a night when you’re cooking with gas, the GM will sit back and let you prompt her for </span><span class="c6">passive clues</span><span class="c1">. When you’re bogging down, she may volunteer what would normally be </span><span class="c6">active clues</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh5"/><span id="b73"/>Core Clues</h3><p class="s2"><span class="c1">For each scene, the GM designates a </span><span class="c6">core clue</span><span class="c1">. This is the clue you absolutely need to move to the next scene, and thus to complete the entire investigation. GMs will avoid making core clues available only with the use of obscure investigative abilities. (For that matter, the character creation system is set up so that the group as a whole will have access to all, or nearly all, of these abilities.) The ability the GM designates is just one possibility, not a straight jacket – if players come up with another plausible method, the GM should give out the information.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Some clues would be obvious to a trained investigator immediately upon entering a scene. These passive clues are provided by the GM without prompting. Scenarios suggest which clues are passive and which are active, but your GM will adjust these in play depending on how much guidance you seem to need. On a night when you’re cooking with gas, the GM will sit back and let you prompt her for passive clues. When you’re bogging down, she may volunteer what would normally be active clues.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh6"/><span id="b74"/>Special Benefits</h3><p class="s2"><span class="c1">Certain clues allow you to gain </span><span class="c6">special benefits</span><span class="c1"> by spending points from the relevant investigative ability pool. During your first few scenarios, your GM will offer you the opportunity to spend additional points as you uncover these clues. After that it’s also up to you to ask if it there’s anything to be gained by spending extra time or effort on a given clue. You can even propose specific ways to improve your already good result; if your suggestion is persuasive or entertaining, the GM may award you a special benefit not mentioned in her scenario notes.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Each benefit costs either 1 or 2 points from the relevant pool, depending on the difficulty of the additional action and the scope of the reward. When asking you if you want to purchase the benefit, the GM always tells you how much it will cost. Additional information gained provides flavor, but is never required to solve the case or move on to a new scene. Often it makes the character seem clever, powerful, or heroic. It may grant you benefits useful later in the scenario, frequently by making a favorable impression on supporting characters. It may allow you to leap forward into the story by gaining a clue that would otherwise only become apparent in a later scene. On occasion, the additional information adds an emotional dimension to the story or ties into the character’s past history or civilian life. If you think of your GUMSHOE game as a TV series, an extra benefit gives the actor playing your character a juicy spotlight scene.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">The act of spending points for benefits is called a </span><span class="c6">spend</span><span class="c1">. The GM’s scenario notes may specify that you get Benefit X for a 1-point spend, or Benefit Y for a 2-point spend. Sometimes minor non-core information is available at no cost.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">GMs of great mental agility who feel comfortable granting their players influence over the details of the narrative may allow them to specify the details of a special benefit.</p><p class="s2 c2">If you wish to make a spend in a situation where the GM has no special benefit to offer you, and cannot think of one that pertains at all to the investigation, you do not lose the points you wish to spend.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh7"/><span id="b75"/>Inconspicuous Clues</h3><p class="s2 c2">Sometimes the characters instinctively notice something without actively looking for it. Often this situation occurs in places they’re moving through casually and don’t regard as scenes in need of intensive searching. The team might pass by a concealed door, spot a droplet of blood on the marble of an immaculate hotel lobby, or approach a vehicle with a bomb planted beneath it. Interpersonal abilities can also be used to find inconspicuous clues. The classic example is of a character whose demeanor or behavioral tics establish them as suspicious.</p><p class="s2 c2">It’s unreasonable to expect players to ask to use their various abilities in what appears to be an innocuous transitional scene. Otherwise they’d have to spend minutes of game time with every change of scene, running down their abilities in obsessive checklist fashion. That way madness lies.</p><p class="s2 c2">Instead the GM asks which character has the highest current pool in the ability in question. (When in doubt for what ability to use for a basic search, the GM defaults to Evidence Collection.)</p><p class="s2 c2">If two or more pools are equal, it goes to the one with the highest rating. If ratings are also equal, their characters find the clue at the same time.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh8"/><span id="b76"/>Simple Searches</h3><p class="s2 c2">Many clues can be found without any ability whatsoever. If an ordinary person could credibly find a clue simply by looking in a specified place, the clue discovery occurs automatically. You, the reader, wouldn’t need to be a trained investigator to find a bloody footprint on the carpet in your living room, or notice a manila envelope taped to the underside of a table at the local pub. By that same logic, the Investigators don’t require specific abilities to find them, either. When players specify that they’re searching an area for clues, they’re performing what we call a simple search.</p><p class="s2 c2">Vary the way you run simple searches according to pacing needs and the preferences of your group. Some players like to feel that their characters are interacting with the imaginary environment. To suit them, use a call-and-response format, describing the scene in a way that suggests places to look. The player prompts back by zeroing in on a detail, at which point you reveal the clue:</p><p class="s29 c2">You: Beside the window stands a roll-top desk.</p><p class="s29 c2">Player: I look inside!</p><p class="s29 c2">You: You find an album full of old photographs.</p><p class="s2 c2">At other times, or for players less interested in these small moments of discovery, you might cut straight to the chase:</p><p class="s29 c2">You: You find an album full of old photographs in the roll-top desk.</p><p class="s2 c2">In the first case, the player who first voices interest in the detail finds the clue. In the second, it goes to, at your discretion:</p><p class="s24"><span class="c14">•</span><span class="c1">the character to whom the clue seems most thematically suited (for example, if you’ve established as a running motif that Agent Jenkins always stumbles on the disgusting clues, and this clue is disgusting, tell his player that he’s once again stepped in it)</span></p><p class="s24"><span class="c14">•</span><span class="c1">a player who hasn’t had a win or spotlight time for a while</span></p><p class="s24"><span class="c14">•</span><span class="c1">the character with the highest Evidence Collection rating</span></p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh9"/>Die Rolls</h2><p class="s2 s5 c2">All die rolls in GUMSHOE use a single ordinary (six-sided) die.</p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh10"/><span id="b77"/>Tests</h2><p class="s2 c2">A test occurs when the outcome of an ability use is in doubt. Tests apply to general skills only. Unlike information gathering attempts, tests carry a fairly high chance of failure. They may portend dire consequences if you lose, provide advantages if you win, or both.</p><p class="s2 c2">Even in the case of general skills, the GM should call for tests only at dramatically important points in the story, and for tasks of exceptional difficulty. Most general ability uses should allow automatic successes, with possible bonuses on point spends, just like investigative abilities.</p><p class="s2 c2">There are two types of test: simple tests and contests.</p><h3><span id="chapter-5-sh11"/><span id="b78"/><span class="c1">Simple Tests</span></h3><p class="s2 c2">A simple test occurs when the character attempts an action without active resistance from another person or entity. Examples include driving a treacherous road, jumping a gorge, sneaking into an unguarded building, binding a wound, shooting a target, disconnecting a security system, or remaining sane in the face of creeping supernatural horror.</p><p class="s2 c2">In the game world, expenditure of pool points in this way represents special effort and concentration by the character, the kind you can muster only so many times during the course of an investigation.</p><p class="s2 c2">The GM does not reveal Difficulty Numbers beforehand. This rule is meant to force players to decide how much they want to commit to the situation, with the gnawing emotional dissonance that comes from the possibility of making the wrong move.</p><h4 class="c2">Difficulty Numbers and Story Pacing</h4><p class="s2 c2">Just as the GUMSHOE system keeps the story moving by making all crucial clues accessible to the characters, GMs must ensure that tests and contests essential to forward narrative momentum can be easily overcome. Assign relatively low Difficulty Numbers of 4 or less to these crucial plot points. Reserve especially hard Difficulty Numbers for obstacles which provide interesting but nonessential benefits.</p><p class="s2 c2">For example, if the characters have to sneak into the cannibal campground in order to stage the final confrontation, assign the relatively low Difficulty Number of 4 to the task. If it seems to the characters that they ought to have a tougher time of it, insert a detail justifying their ease of success. The cannibal assigned to patrol duty might be found passed out at his post, say.</p><p class="s19"><span class="c22">Where it is essential to overcome a General obstacle in order to reach a core scene, allow success whatever the result, but give a negative consequence other than failure for the test. For example, the PC climbs a fence, but receives an injury. This rule never protects characters from Health or Stability loss.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">The test represents the character’s best chance to succeed. Once you fail, you’ve shot your wad and cannot retry unless you take some other supporting action that would credibly increase your odds of success. If allowed to do this, you must spend more pool points than you did on the previous attempt. If you can’t afford it, you can’t retry.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh12"/><span id="b79"/>Piggybacking</h3><p class="s2 c2">When a group of characters act in concert to perform a task together, they designate one to take the lead. That character makes a simple test, spending any number of his own pool points toward the task, as usual. All other characters pay 1 point from their relevant pools in order to gain the benefits of the leader’s action. These points are not added to the leader’s die result. For every character who is unable to pay this piggybacking cost, either because he lacks pool points or does not have the ability at all, the Difficulty Number of the attempt increases by 2.</p><p class="s2 c2">In most instances a group cannot logically act in concert. Only one character can drive a car at one time. Two characters with Preparedness check their individual kits in sequence, rather than checking a single kit at the same time.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh13"/><span id="b80"/>Cooperation</h3><p class="s2 c2">When two characters cooperate toward a single goal, they agree which of them is undertaking the task directly, and which is assisting. The leader may spend any number of points from her pool, adding them to the die roll. The assistant may pay any number of points from his pool. All but one of these is applied to the die roll.</p><h4 class="c2">Continuing Challenges</h4><p class="s2 c2">For tasks where drama, verisimilitude or suspense call for a feeling of repeated effort, assign the obstacle a pool representing the base Difficulty of doing it all at once unaided: this will generally be 8 or higher, often much higher. The tests per se use the standard Difficulty of 4.</p><p class="s2 c2">The players may take turns, cooperate on each action, or use any other means at their disposal in a series of tests: Athletics to batter down a door, or Digital Intrusion to penetrate a firewall, for example. The points they roll and spend accumulate; when they have enough points to overcome the initial Difficulty, the task is done. No points or rolls spent on a failed test add to the total.</p><p class="s2 c2">Characters can’t render an impossible task possible just by applying the continuing challenge rules. </p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh14"/><span id="b81"/>Zero Sum Contests</h2><p class="s2 c2">A zero sum contest occurs when something bad or good is definitely going to happen to one of the PCs, and you need to find out which one takes the hit. Each player makes a test of a general ability. A zero sum contest can be positive or negative. In a positive contest, the character with the highest result gets a benefit. In a negative contest, the one with the lowest result suffers an ill consequence. When embarking on a contest with an open Difficulty, inform the players that this is an open Difficulty, and whether this is a positive or negative test. They then decide in advance how many points to spend to modify their rolls, keeping this number secret from other players by writing it down on a piece of paper. They then roll the dice, reveal their expenditures, and announce their final results. You can cap the maximum spend.</p><p class="s2 c2">Be cautious when treating events with negative outcomes as zero sum contests. Because they guarantee that something bad will definitely happen to one of the PCs, make sure that the negative consequence is distressing but does no permanent harm to the character.</p><p class="s2 c2">Worse results of zero sum contests are acceptable if the characters have had some other fair chance to avoid exposure to the bad situation.</p><p class="s2 c2">If players are tied for best result (in the case of a positive test) or worst (in a negative test), the tied players may subsequently spend any number of additional points from the pool in question, in hopes of breaking the tie in their favor. Should results remain tied after additional expenditures, the GM chooses the winner based on story considerations.</p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh15"/><span id="b82"/>General Spends</h2><p class="s2 c2">Occasionally you’ll want to create a task at which there is no reasonable chance of failure, but which should cost the characters a degree of effort. To do this, simply charge the character(s) a number of points from relevant general ability pools. Where tasks can be performed by cooperative effort, multiple characters may contribute points to them. 1 or 2 points per character is a reasonable general spend.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh16"/>Making General Tests Without Abilities</h3><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[Decide whether you want your game to be unforgiving (grim settings, horror atmosphere) or heroic (upbeat settings featuring omni-competent protagonists), then choose your options from the two choices below.]</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[Forgiving]:</span></p><p class="s2 c2">You can always make a test of any general ability, even when you have no points in its pool, or even if you have a rating of 0. </p><p class="s2"><span class="c5"> [Unforgiving]:</span></p><p class="s2 c2">You can always make a test of any general ability if your rating is 1 or more, whether or not you currently have points in its pool. You can never test a general ability when your rating is 0.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh17"/>Lucky Shots</h3><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[Forgiving settings only.]</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">In a desperate situation, you may be called on to use an general ability you don't have. Once per episode, a character with a rating of 0 in a given ability may attempt a lucky shot. The other players must grant unanimous permission for the character to try a lucky shot. They have a vested interest because the once-per-episode rule applies to the </span><span class="c5">entire cast. </span><span class="c1">If they let you use the lucky shot, none of them will be able to try it later on. </span></p><p class="s2 c2">If allowed to go forward, you spend up to 4 points from your highest current general ability pool, and add it to your roll.</p><p class="s2 c2">Should you succeed, you get the result you wanted, but are required to describe the outcome as somehow fluky or embarrassing. Thus you preserve the sense that the players who invested real points in the ability are the real masters, and you succeeded through sheer happenstance. Alternately, you can succeed with a straight face, but then explain how the victory really belongs to the PC with the highest rating in the ability. Maybe she taught you a few tricks between episodes. Or perhaps you remember something bad-ass she did earlier, and are simply aping it now.</p><h4><span id="b83"/><span class="c1">Toll Tests</span></h4><p class="s4"><span class="c5">[First seen in Ashen Stars, you might find this rule worth including in settings where the investigators regularly build things, or encounter other situations more about cost-benefit than pass-fail.]</span></p><p class="s2 c2">In a toll test, your success is assured, if you want it enough, but the cost of your effort is not. The GM informs you of the Difficulty; you roll the die without announcing an expenditure. Once you see the die result, you then decide whether to spend the points needed to bridge the gap between die roll and Difficulty, or to allow yourself to fail. The base Difficulty of a toll test is 6, which may be modified upwards as circumstances warrant.</p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh18"/><span id="b84"/>Contests</h2><p class="s2 c2">Contests occur when two characters, often a player character and a supporting character controlled by the GM, actively attempt to thwart one another. Although contests can resolve various physical match-ups, in a horror game the most common contest is the chase, in which the investigators run away from slavering entities intent on ripping them limb from limb.</p><p class="s2 c2">In a contest, each character acts in turn. The first to fail a roll of the contested ability loses. The GM decides who acts first. In a chase, the character who bolts from the scene acts first. Where the characters seem to be acting at the same time, the one with the lowest rating in the relevant ability acts first. In the event of a tie, supporting characters act before player characters. In the event of a tie between player characters, the player who arrived last for the current session goes first in the contest.</p><p class="s2 c2">The first character to act makes a test of the ability in question. If he fails, he loses the contest. If he succeeds, the second character then makes a test. This continues until one character loses, at which point the other one wins.</p><p class="s2 c2">Typically each character attempts to beat a Difficulty Number of 4.</p><p class="s2 c2">Where the odds of success are skewed in favor of one contestant, the GM may assign different Difficulties to each. A character with a significant advantage gets a lower Difficulty Number. A character facing a major handicap faces a higher Difficulty Number. When in doubt, the GM assigns the lower number to the advantaged participant.</p><p class="s2 c2">Throughout the contest, GM and players should collaborate to add flavor to each result, explaining what the characters did to remain in the contest. That way, instead of dropping out of the narration to engage in an arithmetical recitation, you keep the fictional world verbally alive .</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh19"/><span id="b85"/>Fighting</h3><p class="s2 c2">Fights are slightly more complicated contests involving any of the following abilities:</p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">Scuffling vs. Scuffling: the characters are fighting in close quarters.</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">Shooting vs. Shooting: the characters are apart from one another and trying to hit each other with guns or other missile weapons</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Initiative</span><span class="c1">: Determine whether the character who attempts to strike the first blow seizes the initiative and therefore gets the first opportunity to strike his opponent, or if his intended target anticipates his attack and beats him to the punch—or shot, as the case may be.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">As GUMSHOE is player-facing, how this works depends on whether the PC in the situation is the aggressor or the defender.</p><p class="s2 c2">In a Scuffling contest, the PC gets to go first if his Scuffling rating equals or exceeds that of his target.</p><p class="s2 c2">In a Shooting contest, he gets to go first if his Shooting rating exceeds that of his target.</p><p class="s2 c2">Otherwise, the opponent goes first.</p><p class="s2 c2">In the rare instance where two PCs fight one another (when one of them is possessed, say), the PC with the higher applicable rating (Scuffling or Shooting) goes first. If their ratings tie but their pools do not, the one with the higher pool goes first. If both are tied, roll a die, with one player going first on an odd result and the other on even.</p><p class="s2 c2">A contest proceeds between the two abilities. When combatants using the Scuffling or Shooting abilities roll well, they get the opportunity to deal damage to their opponents.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Hit Thresholds: </span><span class="c1">Each character has a Hit Threshold of either 3 (the standard value) or 4 (if the character’s Athletics rating is 8 or more.) The Hit Threshold is the Difficulty Number the character’s opponent must match or beat in order to harm him. Less competent supporting characters may have lower Hit Thresholds. Creatures may have Hit Thresholds of 4 or higher, regardless of their Athletics ratings.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Dealing Damage: </span><span class="c1">When you roll on or over your opponent’s Hit Threshold, you may deal damage to him. To do so, you make a damage roll, rolling a die which is then modified according to the relative lethality of your weapon, as per the following table:</span></p><table class="s8" style="margin-left:5.4px;width:65.3%;border-collapse:collapse"><col style="width:65.5%"/><col style="width:34.5%"/><tr style="height:25.2%"><td class="s10 s30 c26">Weapon Type</td><td class="s10 s30 c26">Damage Modifier</td></tr><tr style="height:16.5%"><td class="s10 s30 c2">Fist, kick</td><td class="s14 s33 c2">–2</td></tr><tr style="height:25.2%"><td class="s10 s30 c2">Small improvised weapon, police baton, knife</td><td class="s14 s33 c2">–1</td></tr><tr style="height:16.5%"><td class="s10 s30 c2">Machete, heavy club, light firearm</td><td class="s14 s33"><span class="c1">0</span></td></tr><tr style="height:16.5%"><td class="s10 s30 c2">Sword, heavy firearm</td><td class="s14 s33 c2">+1</td></tr></table><p class="s2 c2">For firearms, add an additional +2 when fired at point blank range.</p><p class="s2 c2">Supernatural creatures often exhibit alarmingly high damage modifiers.</p><p class="s2 c2">Characters may never spend points from their combat pools to increase their damage rolls.</p><p class="s2 c2">The final damage result is then subtracted from your opponent’s Health pool. When a combatant’s Health pool drops to 0 or less, that combatant begins to suffer ill effects, ranging from slight impairment to helplessness to death; see sidebar.</p><p class="s2 c2">Unlike other contests, participants do not lose when they fail their test rolls. Instead, they’re forced out of the fight when they lose consciousness or become seriously wounded.</p><h4 class="c2">Exhaustion, Injury and Death</h4><p class="s2 c2">Unlike most abilities, your Health pool can drop below 0.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">When it does this, you must make a Consciousness Roll. Roll a die with the absolute value</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote2" id="footnote-ref2"><span class="c20"><sup>2</sup></span></a><span class="c1"> of your current Health pool as your Difficulty. You may deliberately strain yourself to remain conscious, voluntarily reducing your Health pool by an amount of your choice. For each point you reduce it, add 1 to your die result. The Difficulty of the Consciousness roll is based on your Health pool </span><span class="c5">before</span><span class="c1"> you make this reduction.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">If your pool is anywhere from 0 to –5</span><span class="c1">, you are </span><span class="c6">hurt</span><span class="c1">, but have suffered no permanent injury, beyond a few superficial cuts and bruises. However the pain of your injuries makes it impossible to spend points on Investigative abilities, and increases the Difficulty Numbers of all tests and contests, including opponents’ Hit Thresholds, by 1.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">A character with the Medic ability can improve your condition by spending Medic points. For every Medic point spent, you regain 2 Health points—unless you are the Medic, in which case you gain only 1 Health point for every Medic point spent. The Medic can only refill your pool to where you were before the incident in which you received this latest injury. He must be in a position to devote all of his attention to directly tending to your wounds.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">If your pool is between –6 and –11</span><span class="c1">, you have been </span><span class="c6">seriously wounded</span><span class="c1">. You must make a Consciousness roll.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Whether or not you maintain consciousness, you are no longer able to fight. Until you receive first aid, you will lose an additional Health point every half hour. A character with the Medic ability can stabilize your condition by spending 2 Medic points. However, he can’t restore your Health points.</p><p class="s2 c2">Even after you receive first aid, you must convalesce in a hospital or similar setting for a period of days. Your period of forced inactivity is a number of days equal to the positive value of your lowest Health pool score. (So if you were reduced to –8 Health, you are hospitalized for 8 days.) On the day of your discharge, your Health pool increases to half its maximum value. On the next day, it refreshes fully.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">When your pool dips to –12 or below</span><span class="c1">, you are </span><span class="c6">dead</span><span class="c1">. Time to create a replacement character.</span></p><h4 class="c2"><span id="b86"/>Bigger Fights</h4><p class="s2"><span class="c1">Combat becomes more chaotic when two groups of combatants fight, or a group gangs up against a single opponent. </span></p><p class="s2 c2">If one group of combatants is surprised by the other (see sidebar), the surprising side goes before the surprised side.</p><p class="s2 c2">Otherwise, determine initiative as follows.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c7">Close-up fight</span><span class="c22">: if any PC has a Scuffling rating equal to or greater than than any combatant on the other side, the PCs act first.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c7">Shoot-out</span><span class="c22">: if any PC has a Shooting rating equal to or greater than than any combatant on the other side, the PCs act first.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Shoot-outs may devolve into scuffles; this does not alter the already-established initiative order.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">The time it takes to go through the ranking order once, with each character taking an action, is called a </span><span class="c6">round</span><span class="c1">. When one round ends, another begins.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">In the course of each round, either the PCs or their enemies go first, as already established by the initiative order. Then the other side responds. The order in which the two sides act remains unchanged from round to round.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">During the portion of the round devoted to the PCs, each participating PC makes an attack in sequence, according to the players’ seating order, from left to right. Sequence becomes irrelevant, obviously, when only one PC is participating (or still standing) in the fight.<span id="b87"/></span></p><p class="s2 c2">In their portion of the round, opponent(s) respond with their own wave of attack attempts, ordered by the characters they’re targeting, again using a left to right player seating order. Where multiple opponents attack a single PC, the GM determines their order of action in whatever manner she finds convenient—usually the order in which she’s tracking them in her rough notes.</p><p class="s2 c2">The order of action can therefore change slightly from round to round for the PCs’ opponents, but not for the PCs.</p><p class="s2 c2">Some beings may strike more than once per round. They make each attack in succession, and may divide them up between opponents within range, or concentrate all of them on a single enemy. GMs order these attacks in whatever order they find convenient, so long as they fall within portion of the round devoted to enemy attacks. Usually it’s easiest to have them act against multiple PCs at once, starting when they reach the first target in the seating order</p><p class="s2 c2">When called upon to act, each character may strike at any opponent within range of his weapons.</p><p class="s2 c2">Creatures may choose to use their actions to deal additional damage to downed or helpless opponents rather than engage active opponents. They automatically deal once instance of damage per action. Only the most crazed and bestial human enemies engage in this behavior.</p><p class="s2 c2">Characters who join a combat in progress come last in order of precedence. If more than two characters join during the same round, the GM determines their relative precedence using the rules above.</p><p class="s2 c2">The fight continues until one side capitulates or flees, or all of its members are unconscious or otherwise unable to continue.</p><h4 class="c2"><span id="b88"/>Surprise</h4><p class="s2 c2">Player characters are surprised when they find themselves suddenly in a dangerous situation. Avoid being surprised with a successful Surveillance test. The basic Difficulty is 4, adjusted by the opponent’s Stealth Modifier.</p><p class="s2 c2">Player characters surprise supporting characters by sneaking up on them with a successful Infiltration or Surveillance test. The basic Difficulty is 4, adjusted by the opponent’s Stealth modifier.</p><p class="s2 c2">Surprised characters suffer a +2 increase to all general ability Difficulties for any immediately subsequent action. In a fight, the penalty pertains to the first round of combat.</p><h4 class="c2"><span id="b89"/>Armor</h4><p class="s2 c2">Armor may reduce the damage from certain weapon types. If you’re wearing a form of armor effective against the weapon being used against you, you subtract a number of points from each instance of damage dealt to you before applying it to your Health pool. Light body armor, as worn by police officers, reduces each instance of damage from bullets by 2 points and from cutting and stabbing weapons (knives, swords, machetes) by 1 point. Military-grade body armor reduces bullet damage by 3 points.</p><p class="s2 c2">Light body armor is heavy, hot, and marks you out as someone looking for trouble. All of these drawbacks apply doubly to military-grade body armor. Investigators can’t expect to walk around openly wearing armor without attracting the attention of the local SWAT team. Armor and heavy weapons may prove useful in discrete missions conducted away from prying eyes.</p><p class="s2 c2">In choosing to make contemporary body armor highly effective against firearms, we’re drawing on the portrayal of Kevlar vests in cop shows and movies. We make no claims for any resemblance between these rules and real life. The rules also favor close-up physical confrontations, which are more in keeping with the horror genre than firefights. GMs using the GUMSHOE rules in more realistic, horror-free investigative settings may wish to reduce the effectiveness of body armor against gunfire.</p><p class="s2 c2">Creatures often have high armor ratings. They may possess hard, bony hides or monstrous anatomies that can take greater punishment than ordinary organisms. Most supernatural creatures are more resistant to bullets and other missile weapons than they are to blunt force trauma, slashes, and stab wounds.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[Delete or modify references to supernatural creatures as needed for your genre.]</span></p><h4 class="c2"><span id="b90"/>Cover</h4><p class="s2 c2">In a typical gunfight, combatants seek cover, hiding behind walls, furniture or other barriers, exposing themselves only for the few seconds it takes them to pop up and fire a round at their targets. The GUMSHOE rules recognize three cover conditions:</p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Exposed: </span><span class="c1">No barrier stands between you and the combatant firing at you. Your Hit Threshold decreases by 1.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Partial Cover: </span><span class="c1">About half of your body is exposed to fire. Your Hit Threshold remains unchanged.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Full Cover: </span><span class="c1">Except when you pop up to fire a round, the barrier completely protects you from incoming fire. Your Hit Threshold increases by 1.</span></p><h6 class="c27">One Gun, Two Combatants</h6><p class="s2 c2">If your opponent has a gun well in hand and ready to fire, and you charge him from more than five feet away, he can empty his entire clip or chamber at you before you get to him, badly injuring you. You are automatically hit. He rolls one instance of damage, which is then tripled. Yes, we said tripled. And, yes, the tripling occurs after weapon modifiers are taken into account. This is why few people charge when their opponents have the drop on them.</p><p class="s2 c2">If your opponent has a pistol but it is not well in hand and ready to fire, you may attempt to jump him and wrestle it from his grip. If he has a pistol well in hand but is unaware of your presence, you may also be able to jump him, at the GM’s discretion. The characters engage in a Scuffling contest to see which of them gets control of the gun and fires it. The winner makes a damage roll against the loser, using the pistol’s Damage Modifier, including the +2 for point blank range.</p><p class="s2 c2">If you jump an opponent with an unready rifle, a Scuffling combat breaks out, with the opponent using the rifle as a heavy club.</p><h4 class="c2"><span id="b91"/>Ammo Capacity</h4><p class="s2"><span class="c5">The</span><span class="c1"> </span><span class="c5">Esoterrorists </span><span class="c1">sets aside the loving attention to firearm intricacies characteristic of most contemporary-era RPG systems. For example, characters need reload only when dramatically appropriate. Otherwise, they’re assumed to be able to refill the cylinders of their revolvers or jam clips into their automatic weapons between shots.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">When reloading is an issue, GMs may request a Shooting test (Difficulty 3) to quickly reload. Characters who fail may not use their Shooting ability to attack during the current round.</p><h4 class="c2"><span id="b92"/>Range</h4><p class="s2 c2">The effect of range on firearms combat is likewise simplified nearly out of existence. Handguns and shotguns can only be accurately fired at targets within fifty meters. The range limit for rifles is one hundred meters.</p><h4 class="c2"><span id="b93"/>Non-Lethal Weapons</h4><p class="s2"><span class="c1">In GUMSHOE, non-lethal attacks never take an opponent out faster than standard combat. Otherwise players will have their characters simply knock their enemies out and kill them in cold blood, which is unsympathetic and out of genre. Thus tasers and stun guns work less effectively in the game than in real life.<span id="b94"/></span></p><h4 class="c2">Fighting Without Abilities</h4><p class="s2 c2">A character with a Shooting rating of 0 is not allergic to guns. Anyone can pick up a revolver and empty it in the general direction of the foe. Likewise, a character with no Scuffling ability is not going to just ignore the fire axe sitting on the wall when a blood bursts through a partition wall.</p><p class="s2 c2">However, such characters will use their weapons ineffectively and hesitantly. Using a weapon (including fists or feet) without ability has the following drawbacks:</p><p class="s24"><span class="c14">•</span><span class="c1">You automatically do an additional -2 damage</span></p><p class="s24"><span class="c14">•</span><span class="c1">You must declare your action at the beginning of each round and cannot change it if the tactical situation alters.</span></p><p class="s24"><span class="c14">•</span><span class="c1">You automatically go last in each round.</span></p><p class="s24"><span class="c14">•</span><span class="c1">If you are using a firearm, a roll of 1 means you have accidentally shot yourself or one of your allies, as selected (or rolled randomly) by the GM. Do damage as normal (including your automatic -2 penalty).</span></p><h4 class="c2">Called Shots</h4><p class="s4"><span class="c5">[Use only for especially combat-oriented GUMSHOE games.]</span></p><p class="s2 c2">In certain situations simply hitting an enemy isn’t enough: you need to get him in a particular spot. When taking a called shot, specify the desired location of the strike and any additional intended effect other than injury to the opponent. The GM decides whether this is a likely outcome of such a hit. If it is clearly not a likely outcome, and your character would logically know this, she warns you in advance, so you can do something else instead.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">The GM then adds 1 to 4 points to the target’s Hit Threshold, depending on the additional difficulty entailed. Use the following table as a guideline. Body locations assume a human of ordinary size. Hit Threshold modifiers for ordinary body parts of extraordinary creatures are left as an exercise for the GM. </span><span class="c5">Vehicle locations are in italics.</span></p><p class="s2"> </p><table class="s8" style="margin-left:2.8px;width:62.3%;border-collapse:collapse"><col style="width:69.5%"/><col style="width:30.5%"/><tr style="height:12.0%"><td class="s10 s37 s38 c28">Desired Location</td><td class="s41"><p class="s42 s43 c28">Modifier to</p><p class="s42 s44 c28"> Hit Threshold</p></td></tr><tr style="height:12.0%"><td class="s10 s45 s46 c2">Large carried object (rocket launcher, laptop computer, backpack)</td><td class="s14 s45 s49 c2">+1</td></tr><tr style="height:8.0%"><td class="s10 s45 s46"><span class="c1">Torso, </span><span class="c5">windshield</span></td><td class="s14 s45 s49 c2">+1</td></tr><tr style="height:8.0%"><td class="s10 s45 s46 c2">Chest (if attacker is facing target)</td><td class="s14 s45 s49 c2">+2</td></tr><tr style="height:8.0%"><td class="s10 s45 s46"><span class="c1">Gut, </span><span class="c5">specific window, tail rotor</span></td><td class="s14 s45 s49 c2">+2</td></tr><tr style="height:8.0%"><td class="s10 s45 s46 c2">Head or limb</td><td class="s14 s45 s49 c2">+2</td></tr><tr style="height:8.0%"><td class="s10 s45 s46"><span class="c1">Hand or foot, joint, </span><span class="c5">tire</span></td><td class="s14 s45 s49 c2">+3</td></tr><tr style="height:8.0%"><td class="s10 s45 s46 c2">Heart, throat, mouth, or face</td><td class="s14 s45 s49 c2">+3</td></tr><tr style="height:8.0%"><td class="s10 s45 s46 c2">Weapon or other hand-held object</td><td class="s14 s45 s49 c2">+3</td></tr><tr style="height:8.0%"><td class="s10 s45 s46"><span class="c1">Eye, </span><span class="c5">headlight</span></td><td class="s14 s45 s49 c2">+4</td></tr><tr style="height:12.0%"><td class="s10 s45 s46 c2">Chest (if target faces away from attacker)</td><td class="s14 s45 s49 c2">+4</td></tr></table><p class="s2"> </p><p class="s2 c2">With the new Hit Threshold determined, you then make a combat ability test, as per the standard rules. If you succeed, your specified effect occurs as desired.</p><p class="s2 c2">If you struck an ordinary person in the head, throat, or chest with a weapon, add +2 to the damage; hitting the heart adds +3 to the damage. Neither can be combined with a point-blank gunshot, which is already assumed to hit a vital location.</p><p class="s2 c2">If you struck an ordinary person in a joint (wrist, knee, etc.) or throat with an aimed hand-to-hand blow, lock, or kick, add +2 to the damage; hitting an eye adds +3 to the damage.</p><p class="s2 c2">This assumes a trained, targeted strike intended to disable or cripple. You may narrate some other crippling strike to suit your own specific martial arts idiom, but the modifiers remain the same if you want to do the extra damage.</p><p class="s2 c2">If, after this damage is dealt, the victim is already Hurt but not Seriously Wounded, you may then pay an additional 6 points from the fighting ability you are using to reduce the target to -6 Health. If the target is already Seriously Wounded you may then pay an additional 6 Shooting, Weapons, or Hand-to-Hand points (whichever applies) to kill the target outright.</p><h4 class="c2">Combat Options</h4><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[Games featuring extensive fight sequences may benefit from the addition of combat options.

The Difficulty is 3 plus the number of foes you're fleeing from: to flee one enemy is Difficulty 4, fleeing two enemies is Difficulty 5, fleeing four enemies is Difficulty 7. On a success, melee ends and you flee; if they intend to chase you, your foes must roll first in the ensuing full contest of Athletics. If you fail, the opponent with the highest damage value automatically deals one instance of damage to you. Melee still ends, but you must roll first in the ensuing chase.</p><p class="s2 c2">In situations where it seems appropriate to make flight more difficult, on a failure, any directly engaged opponent might spend 3 Athletics to block you from fleeing—interposing himself between you and the exit, tackling you, slamming the garage doors, or whatever the narrative description warrants.

Characters who would logically be inured to a given event face a Difficulty of 3, while those especially susceptible face a 5. A character whose daytime identity is that of a surgeon or coroner might, for example, face a lowered Difficulty when encountering gruesomely mutilated bodies.

You are haunted by dreams of the incident, and spend your days in a constant state of anxiety and alert, as if prepared for it to repeat itself at any moment. Whenever your senses register any input reminding you of the incident, you must make a Stability test (Difficulty 4) or freeze up. If you freeze up, you are unable to take any action for fifteen minutes and remain </span><span class="c6">shaken </span><span class="c1">(see above) for twenty-four hours after that. Tests to see if you show symptoms of PTSD do not in and of themselves lower your Stability pool.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">If driven to mental illness by a supernatural occurrence, you face a range of possible mental disorders. The GM rolls on the following chart or chooses a disorder based on the triggering circumstance. The player is then sent out of the room, while the GM and other players collaborate on a way to heighten his sense of dislocation and disorientation.</p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c29">1.</span><span class="c6">Delusion. </span><span class="c1">The other players and GM decide on a mundane detail of the world which is no longer true and has never been true. For example, there might be no such thing as a squirrel, a Volkswagen, or orange juice. Maybe John Lennon was never assassinated, or never existed in the first place. PCs and supporting characters deny knowledge of the chosen item, person, or event.</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c30">2.</span><span class="c6">Homicidal Mania. </span><span class="c1">The GM takes the player aside, tells him that he knows one of the other players is a supernatural creature, and tells him just how to kill the monster.</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c30">3.</span><span class="c6">Megalomania. </span><span class="c1">When the character fails at a dramatic moment, the GM describes the outcome of his ability attempt as successful, then asks the player to leave the room.

For every Shrink point spent, the recipient gains 2 Stability points.</p><p class="s2 c2">If a character is acting in an erratic manner due to mental illness, a another character can spend 2 points of Shrink to snap him into a state of temporary lucidity. He will then act rationally for the remainder of the current scene.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh24"/><span id="b99"/>Head Games</h3><p class="s2 c2">Mental illness can be cured through prolonged treatment using the Shrink ability. At the beginning of each scenario, in a prologue scene preceding the main action, the character administering the treatment makes a Shrink test (Difficulty 4.) After three consecutive successful tests, and three consecutive scenarios in which the patient remains above 0 Stability at all times, the mental illness goes away.</p><p class="s2 c2">However, if the character ever again acquires a mental illness, he regains the condition he was previously cured of. Permanent cure then becomes impossible.</p><p class="s2 c2">A successful Shrink test undertaken during the course of a scenario suppresses its symptoms until the patient next suffers a Stability loss.</p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh25"/><span id="b100"/>Regaining Pool Points</h2><p class="s2 c2">Spent points from various pools are restored at different rates, depending on their narrative purpose.</p><p class="s2 c2">Investigative ability pools are restored only at the end of each case, without regard to the amount of time that passes in the game world. Players seeking to marshal their resources may ask you how long cases typically run, in real time. Most groups finish scenarios over 2-3 sessions. Players may revise their sense of how carefully to manage point spending as they see how quickly their group typically disposes of its cases.</p><p class="s2 c2">(GMs running extremely long, multi-part investigations may designate certain story events as breakpoints where all investigative pools are refreshed. For example, a globe-hopping investigation where the team meets a separate team of Esoterrorists enemies in five different locales might allow refreshment of investigative pools after each group of enemies is neutralized.)</p><p class="s2 c2">Use of the Shrink ability permits limited recovery of Stability points in the course of an episode. Full refreshment occurs between cases. It is possible only when the character is able to spend calm, undisturbed quality time with friends and loved ones uninvolved in the shadowy world of the Ordo Veritatis. In campaigns where the teammates’ personal lives are a matter of background detail only, refreshment automatically occurs between episodes.</p><p class="s2 c2">GMs who wish to add a soap opera element to their campaigns, in which the characters must balance the everyday pressures of ordinary life against their activities as covert battlers of the supernatural, can complicate this process. In this campaign type, the characters must work to keep their support networks intact. If they fail, they regain no Stability between episodes. As part of the character creation process, players must detail their network of friends and loved ones in a paragraph or two of background text, which is then submitted to the GM for approval.</p><p class="s2 c2">The Health pool refreshes over time, at a rate of 2 points per day of restful activity. (Wounded characters heal at a different rate, over a period of hospitalization.) Use of the Medic ability can restore a limited number of Health points in the course of a session.</p><p class="s2 c2">Pools for the physical abilities of Athletics, Driving, Scuffling, and Shooting are fully restored whenever twenty-four hours of game-world time elapses since the last expenditure. The remaining general abilities refresh at the end of each case, like investigative abilities.</p><p class="s2 s5 c2">[[[BEGIN SIDEBAR]]]</p><h4 class="c2">What Do Pool Points Represent?</h4><p class="s2 c2">Pool points are a literary abstraction, representing the way that each character gets his or her own time in the spotlight in the course of an ensemble drama. When you do something remarkable, you expend a little bit of your spotlight time. More active players will spend their points sooner than less demonstrative ones, unless they carefully pick and choose their moments to shine.</p><p class="s2 c2">Remember, all characters are remarkably competent. Pool points measure your opportunities to exercise this ultra-competence during any given scenario. Even when pools are empty, you still have a reasonable chance to succeed at a test, and you’ll always get the information you need to move forward in the case.</p><p class="s2 c2">Pool points do not represent a resource, tangible or otherwise, in the game world. Players are aware of them, but characters are not. The team members’ ignorance of them is analogous to TV characters’ obliviousness to commercial breaks, the unwritten rules of scene construction, and the tendency of events to heat up during sweeps.</p><p class="s2 c2">We represent this most purely in the case of investigative skills, which are the core of the game. Their refreshment is tied to a purely fictional construct, the length of the episode.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">However, where a pool could be seen to correspond to a resource perceptible to the characters, we handle refreshment in a somewhat more realistic, if also abstract, manner. Characters’ ebbing Health scores are perceptible to the characters in the form of welts, cuts, pain, and general fatigue</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote4" id="footnote-ref4"><span class="c20"><sup>4</sup></span></a><span class="c1">. Stability is less tangible but can be subjectively measured in the characters’ moods and reactions. Physical abilities, also tied to fatigue and sharpness of reflexes, are also handled with a nod to the demands of realism.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">[[[END SIDEBAR]]]</p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh26"/><span id="b101"/>Improving Your Character</h2><p class="s2 c2">At the end of each investigation, each player gets 2 build points for each session they participated in. (This assumes a small number of 3-4 hour sessions; if you play in shorter bursts, modify accordingly.) Players who had characters die in the course of the investigation only get points for each session involving their current character.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">These build points can be spent to increase either investigative or general abilities. You may acquire new abilities or bolster existing ones. If necessary to preserve credibility, rationalize new abilities as areas of expertise you’ve had all along, but are only revealing later in the series.<span id="b102"/></span></p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh27"/><span id="b103"/>Opponent Statistics</h2><p class="s2 c2">You usually only need game statistics for characters, including ODEs, that the investigators in some way have to overcome through general abilities. Most witnesses, suspects and non-combatants require only a text description, indicating for example which interpersonal abilities they’re most likely to respond to.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">Opponents use the same Hit Threshold and Weapon Damage rules as player characters.<span id="b104"/></span></p><p class="s2 c2">When choosing Health ratings for dramatically unimportant foes, don’t worry about simulating their relative robustness in comparison to the general population. Focus on how many hits they ought to be able to take before dropping, according to dramatic logic. If you want a thug who falls to a single burst of automatic fire, give him a Health of 1 or 2.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">An </span><span class="c6">Attack Pattern</span><span class="c1"> is an optional game statistic suggesting how the opponent might spend its Scuffling and/or Shooting points from round to round of a fight. GMs should always consult story logic and dramatic needs first and resort to the attack pattern second. You might want a vast lumbering creature to smash doors and walls around the PCs, and a small vicious ODE to attack with unerring precision. These numbers are a fallback if you can’t decide how the opponent would spend, or are uncomfortable choosing to spend enough to guarantee a hit each time. Don’t use them just because they’re there, even if you find the pull of numbers—oh, sweet, beautiful numbers—generally irresistible.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">When you do use the Attack Pattern, increase the spends after each miss until the opponent either starts to hit, or runs out of points. Once engaged, opponents figure out how hard the PCs are to hit, and adjust their efforts accordingly. </p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Armor</span><span class="c1"> is subtracted from each instance of damage the opponent takes. Where a weapon or weapons is listed in brackets after the number, the Armor reduces damage only from those weapons. Some Armor may protect against all Scuffling attacks but not Shooting attacks, or vice versa.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">An opponent’s </span><span class="c6">Alertness Modifier</span><span class="c1"> represents its ability to sense your activities, whether through standard senses like sight and hearing, or exotic ones like echolocation, pheromone recognition, or energy signature reading. When you try to sneak past it, the Alertness Modifier is applied to your base Infiltration Difficulty, which is usually 4. It also applies to Surveillance tests when you’re trying to observe the opponent without being observed in turn. The Alertness Modifier reflects all of the individual’s sensing capabilities, both natural and technological. A second number appearing after a slash represents the opponent’s Alertness if its gear is somehow neutralized or taken away.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">An opponent with a </span><span class="c6">Stealth Modifier </span><span class="c1">is either significantly harder or easier to spot with Surveillance. It alters the difficulty number for that or similar tests.</span></p><h4 class="c2">Sample Creature Stat Block: Lipovore</h4><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Abilities</span><span

possible, player-facing. When you as GM have the choice between making a determination based on a player test, or on a test made by you on behalf of a supporting character, always choose the player. For example, you may want to specify that there’s a chance a harried relative of a kidnapping victim might eventually lose her patience with the investigators and participate in a damaging press conference. Rather than having her make a Stability test to see when and if this happens, set it up so that a player makes a Reassurance spend to forestall her.</p><p class="s2 c2">Likewise, if you want to have a supporting character steal something in a situation where the PCs are in no position to affect the outcome, simply decree that it happens. Don’t bother testing the character’s Filch ability. To do otherwise is to engage in false branching: you are creating unpredictability for yourself in a way that remains invisible to the players. They don’t get a chance to alter the outcome, and thus gain no benefit from the uncertainty you’ve introduced.</p><p class="s2 s5"> </p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh38"/><span id="b115"/>Hazards</h2><p class="s2 c2">In or out of combat, the characters’ survival may be threatened by assorted hazards, from electrical shock to poisoning. </p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh39"/><span id="b116"/>Electricity and Other Shocks</h3><p class="s2 c2">Damage from exposure to electricity varies according to voltage.

You suffer one die of damage, with a +4 modifier. </span></p><p class="s2 c2">The GM should always give you some opportunity to avoid being shocked, whether it be an Athletics test to avoid unexpected contact, or a Surveillance test to spot the danger. </p><p class="s2 c2">If you are reduced to –6 or fewer Health, the current is assumed to have traveled through your heart or brain, causing cardiac arrest or brain damage, respectively. The GM describes appropriate symptoms and futuristic treatments during your sick bay convalescence. </p><p class="s2 c2">Many other hazards can be emulated using the mild/moderate/extreme breakdown above. Simply change the narrative description and side effects, keeping the Health pool losses. </p><h4 class="c2">Example Hazard Description: Alien Fungal Infection</h4><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Mild</span><span class="c1">: For the next two intervals, you lose 2 Health every time you make an Athletics test. </span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Moderate</span><span class="c1">: Make a Health test against a Difficulty of 4. If you fail, you suffer an extreme shock at the beginning of the next interval. </span></p><h4 class="c2">Example Hazard Description: Ion Storm</h4><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Mild</span><span class="c1">: For the next interval, you lose all benefits from your cybernetic enhancements. </span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Moderate</span><span class="c1">: Your cybernetic enhancements all go offline, returning after three intervals. You may activate any or all of them before this time by spending 2 Health per enhancement. </span></p><h4 class="c2">Example Hazard Description:Temporal Shock</h4><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Mild</span><span class="c1">: For the remainder of the interval, you lose 1 Health each time you use an Academic or Technical ability. </span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Moderate</span><span class="c1">: For the remainder of the interval, the Difficulty of any general ability rolls increases by 2. </span></p><p class="s2 s5 c2">[Hazard descriptions from Ashen Stars.]</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh40"/><span id="b117"/>Fire</h3><p class="s2 c2">Damage from exposure to fire varies according to the surface area of your body exposed to the flame, and repeats for each round (or, outside of combat, every few seconds) you remain exposed to it. </p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Minor exposure, </span><span class="c1">most often to an extremity like a hand or foot, carries a damage modifier of –2. </span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Partial exposure, </span><span class="c1">to up to half of your surface area, carries a damage modifier of +0. </span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Extensive exposure, </span><span class="c1">to half or more of your surface area, imposes a damage modifier of +2. </span></p><p class="s2 c2">The GM should always give you a chance to avoid being set on fire. The difficulty of extinguishing a flame is usually 4, but might be higher for anomalous flame-like manifestations, or when you are coated with a futuristic accelerant.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh41"/><span id="b118"/>Suffocation</h3><p class="s2 c2">When deprived of air, you get two minutes before the nastiness kicks in. After that point, you lose 1 Athletics every ten seconds, as you struggle to hold your breath. Once that pool depletes, you start losing Health, at a rate of 1 point every five seconds. </p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-5-sh42"/><span id="b119"/>Toxins</h3><p class="s2 s5 c2">Toxins are either inhaled, ingested or injected directly into the bloodstream. They vary widely in lethality. A dose of a low-tech cleaning substance may impose a damage modifier of –2, where a viro-active nerve gas might range from +6 to +16. Inhaled toxins tend to take effect right away. Injected and ingested toxins take delayed effect, anywhere from minutes to hours after exposure. Their damage might be parceled out in increments, and may prevent you from refreshing Health points until somehow neutralized. As with any hazard, the GM should always give you a chance to avoid exposure to them. </p></div></body></html>
