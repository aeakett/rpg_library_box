You create characters by spending build points on your character’s abilities. Each ability has a numerical rating. Every rating point costs 1 build point to purchase.</p><p class="s2 c2">The GUMSHOE rules define your character by what he or she can accomplish in an investigative scenario. The component elements of each ability don’t matter in rules terms. The rules don’t care if your Forensic Accounting ability is one part native mental acuity to two parts training or vice versa, although you can mention them when describing your character to others. All that matters is how you solve cases, and overcome other obstacles arising from them.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh1"/><span id="b3"/>Ratings and Pools</h3><p class="s2"><span class="c1">The number you assign to each ability is called a </span><span class="c6">rating</span><span class="c1">. Although you may improve them gradually over time, ratings remain static over the course of the typical game session.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">For each ability your character has a </span><span class="c6">pool</span><span class="c1"> of points, which fluctuates over the course of each session. You begin each case, or scenario, with pool points equal to your rating. You might then immediately spend some of them during a prelude phase to the investigation itself. You will definitely spend points as you conduct the investigation. At times your pool may increase, sometimes </span><span class="c6">refreshing</span><span class="c1"> to equal its rating again.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">The distinction between ratings and pools is a crucial one; keep it in mind as you read and interpret the GUMSHOE rules.</p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh2"/><span id="b4"/>Step One: Concept </h2><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[Describe the sorts of mystery-solving characters the players will play in your setting, and any preliminary creative decisions each player will make about her character.]</span></p><p class="s2 s3"> </p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh3"/>Stereotypes</h3><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[In some games you may wish to guide players to choose genre-appropriate concepts by supplying a list of stereotypes as a starting point in character creation.]</span></p><h4 class="c2">Sample Stereotype: Good Girl</h4><p class="s2 c2"><span id="b5"/>The good girl is an ordinary young woman. If not chaste, she's more modest and circumspect about her sexuality than the other young women in the cast of characters. Smart and cautious, she becomes the ultimate prize of the shadowy forces stalking the group—often proving herself more determined to survive than those around her. </p><p class="s4"><span class="c5">[From Fear Itself]</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh4"/>Packages</h3><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[In some games you may choose to give additional mechanical heft to the stereotypes by turning them into Packages.]</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Each package sets out minimum requirements in both Investigative and General abilities. Before spending any points elsewhere, make sure you have those covered.</p><h4 class="c2">Sample Package: Communications Officer (Hailer)</h4><p class="s2 c2">You establish, receive and route communications with other ships, planetary installations, and space stations. More than a glorified space receptionist, you serve as a combination of public relations frontperson and psychological warrior. You facilitate the decision-making process of the crew and convey its intentions to the outside world. In crisis situations, you keep vital information flowing to the stratco, so that the right decisions get made at lightning speed. During space combat, you launch hack attacks on the enemy’s computer system, while defending your own from penetration.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Investigative:</span><span class="c1"> Linguistics 1, Flattery 1, Reassurance 1, Decryption 1, Data Retrieval 1</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">General</span><span class="c1">: Communications Intercept 6, Sense Trouble 4</span></p><p class="s2 s5"><span class="c5">[From Ashen Stars]</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh5"/>Occupations</h3><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[A variant of the Package sub-system, the Occupation, appears in Trail of Cthulhu. Rather than providing minimums to qualify for a package, an Occupation provides key abilities at half-price, and often a Special mechanical benefit as well. Future Pelgrane GUMSHOE designs will likely stick to the faster, simpler ability minimum approach found in Packages.]</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">You get two rating points in </span><span class="c6">Occupational abilities</span><span class="c1"> for every one build point you spend. For example, 12 rating points of Occupational abilities cost you 6 build points. Left over half-points are lost, so assign an even number points to Occupational abilities. </span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh6"/>Sample Occupation: Private Investigator</h3><p class="s2 c2">There are things that cops can’t do, and things that cops won’t do, and you’ll take money to do either. Sometimes you get dragged into something the cops want you out of, but you gotta stay in it to keep the cops honest. What keeps you honest? Now, that’s the real mystery, ain’t it?</p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Occupational Abilities: </span><span class="c1">Accounting, Disguise, Driving, Law, Locksmith, Photography, Assess Honesty, Reassurance, Scuffling, Shadowing. </span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c6">Special:</span><span class="c1"> Private eyes with point pools in Disguise or Shadowing may spend points </span><span class="c5">after</span><span class="c1"> rolling the die for a test. For every 2 points you spend </span><span class="c5">after</span><span class="c1"> rolling the die, you increase the die result by 1. This </span><span class="c5">only</span><span class="c1"> applies if you are undistracted and not directly observed. It never applies during a contest. You must describe the thing that almost went wrong, and how you caught it barely in time or succeeded through sheer luck.</span></p><p class="s2 s5"><span class="c5">[From Trail of Cthulhu]</span></p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh7"/><span id="b6"/>Step Two: Assign Investigative Abilities</h2><p class="s2 c2">Investigative abilities are central to any GUMSHOE character; they enable you to gather information and drive the plot forward. The number of points each player spends on investigative abilities varies according to the number of regularly attending players, according to the following table. The GM leads the group through the list of investigative build points, ensuring that each one of them is covered by at least one member of the group.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[Complete this chart with values based on the total number of investigative abilities you include in your game. That number is x. The final numbers don’t have to be dead on, so fudge them upwards if desired for a prettier-looking numerical progression.]</span></p><p class="s2 s3"> </p><table class="s8" style="margin-left:5.4px;width:54.7%;border-collapse:collapse"><col style="width:32.6%"/><col style="width:67.4%"/><tr style="height:20.0%"><td class="s10 s9 c2"># of players</td><td class="s10 s9 c2">Investigative Build Points</td></tr><tr style="height:20.0%"><td class="s14 s9 s13"><span class="c1">2</span></td><td class="s14 s9 s13 c10">80% of x</td></tr><tr style="height:20.0%"><td class="s14 s9 s13"><span class="c1">3</span></td><td class="s14 s9 s13 c10">60% of x</td></tr><tr style="height:20.0%"><td class="s14 s9 s13"><span class="c1">4</span></td><td class="s14 s9 s13 c10">55% of x</td></tr><tr style="height:20.0%"><td class="s14 s9 s13 c2">5+</td><td class="s14 s9 s13 c10">50% of x </td></tr></table><p class="s2"> </p><p class="s2 c2">Players who can only attend every now and then get the same number of investigative build points as everyone else, but are not counted toward the total when deciding how many points to allocate.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh8"/>Free Rating</h3><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[If your setting concept assumes all characters will have a particular ability (like Cop Talk if everyone is a police officer), indicate what it is, and that everyone gets 1 rating point in it for free.]</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh9"/><span id="b7"/>What Good Are Investigative Ratings?</h3><p class="s2 c2">Players used to the bumbling half-competence of their characters in other investigative game systems may be surprised to learn how effective even a single rating point is.</p><p class="s2 c2">Any rating in an investigative ability indicates a high degree of professional accomplishment or impressive natural talent. If you have an ability relevant to the task at hand, you automatically succeed in discovering any information or overcoming any obstacles necessary to propel you from the current scene further into the story.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">You may ask to spend points to gain </span><span class="c6">special benefits</span><span class="c1">. Sometimes the GM will offer you the chance to spend points. In other circumstances she may accept your suggestions of ways to gain special benefits. Use them wisely; spent points do not return until the next investigation begins.</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Once all of the abilities are covered, you are permitted, if you desire, to reserve any remaining build points to spend as situations arise during play. You may assign yourself additional abilities, or increase your ratings in the ones you’ve chosen, as seems appropriate to your character and the situations she finds herself in. When you choose to do this, you are not suddenly acquiring abilities on the spot, but simply revealing for the first time what the character has been able to do all along.</p><p class="s2 c2">If you want, you can save build points from character creation to spend later. If your GM is running an ongoing series, you will accumulate additional build points during play.</p><h4 class="c2">Investigative Benchmarks</h4><p class="s2 c2">When choosing investigative abilities it is better to get a large number of abilities with fairly low ratings. Even a 1-point rating is worth having. You’ll rarely want to spend more than 3 or 4 points on any one investigative ability.</p><p class="s2 c2">You must have an investigative ability at a rating of at least 1 to get useful information from it.</p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh10"/><span id="b8"/>Step 3: Assign General Abilities</h2><p class="s2 c2">Each player gets 60 points to spend on general abilities, regardless of group size.</p><p class="s2 c2">General abilities use different rules than investigative ones, which allow for possible failure. They help you survive while you investigating. When choosing general abilities, you’ll want to concentrate your points among a few abilities, giving your comparatively higher ratings than you want in the investigative category.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c5"> [To support 60 as the value for general build points, include approximately 12 broadly useful general abilities. Some games may also support specialized general abilities on top of the 12. You may wish to assign an additional build pool to another class of general abilities unique to your setting.]</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">You start the game with 1 point </span><span class="c5">[each]</span><span class="c1"> in Health and </span><span class="c5">[any other similar ablative ability required for the setting’s genre emulation, like Stability in most GUMSHOE horror games.]</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Although there is no set cap on abilities, the second highest rating must be at least half that of the highest rating.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh11"/><span id="b9"/>What Good are General Ratings?</h3><p class="s2 c2">General abilities use a different set of rules and are measured on a different scale than investigative abilities. The two ability sets are handled in different way because they fulfill distinct narrative functions. The rules governing general abilities introduce the possibility of failure into the game, creating suspense and uncertainty. Uncertain outcomes make scenes of physical action more exciting, but can stop a mystery story dead if applied to the collection of information. This division may seem aesthetically weird when you first encounter it, but as you grow used to the GUMSHOE system you’ll see that it works.</p><p class="s2 c2">GUMSHOE focuses not on your character’s innate traits, but on what they can actually do in the course of a storyline. Why they can do it is up to each player. Your characters are as strong, fast, and good-looking as you want them to be.</p><h4 class="c2">General Ability Benchmarks</h4><p class="s2 c2">A rating of 1-3 indicates that the ability is a sideline. 4-7 is solid but not off the charts. 8 or more suggests a dedicated bad-assery that will be immediately apparent to observers when they see you in action.</p><h4 class="c2">0-Rated General Abilities</h4><p class="s19 c12">If you have a rating of 0 in a general ability, that is you have put no build points into it, you cannot make a test on that ability. That is not to say you can't do the thing at all; it's only if you want to attempt something requiring a roll that you will not succeed. You character might be able to drive, but with a Drive rating of 0 you will not be able to deal with a car chase or potential crash.	</p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh12"/><span id="b10"/>Investigative Abilities</h2><p class="s2 c2">The following abilities are the bread and butter of GUMSHOE characters.</p><p class="s2 c2">Ability descriptions consist of a brief general description, followed by examples of their use in an investigation. Creative players should be able to propose additional uses for their abilities as unexpected situations confront their characters.</p><p class="s2 c2">Certain specific actions may overlap between a couple of abilities. For example, you can enhance image resolution with either Data Retrieval or Photography.</p><p class="s2 c2">Some abilities, like Research, are broadly useful, and will crop up constantly. Others may be called for many times in the course of one scenario, and not at all in others. When building your character, strike a balance between the reliable workhouse abilities and their exotic, specialized counterparts.</p><p class="s2 c2">Investigative abilities are divided into the following sub-groups: Academic, Interpersonal, and Technical. The purpose of the sub-groups is to allow you to quickly find the best ability for the task during play, by scanning the most likely portion of the overall list.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[Rewrite investigative ability descriptions and example bullet points as needed for your setting. Rename abilities for desired flavor. Create new abilities keyed to your setting. Include only abilities relevant to your setting in your game. Some investigative abilities tie into specific general abilities and vice versa; make sure you either include both relevant abilities, or drop the cross-references between them.]</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh13"/><span id="b11"/>Anthropology (Academic)</h3><p class="s2 c2">You are an expert in the study of human cultures, from the stone age to the Internet age.</p><p class="s2 c2">You can:</p><p class="s2 s20"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">identify artifacts and rituals of living cultures</span></p><p class="s2 s20"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">describe the customs of a foreign group or local subculture</span></p><p class="s2 s20"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">extrapolate the practices of an unknown culture from similar examples</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh14"/><span id="b12"/>Archaeology (Academic)</h3><p class="s2 c2">You excavate and study the structures and artifacts of historical cultures and civilizations.

You must usually be interacting with them or observing them from a close distance, but sometimes you can spot liars on television, too. Unfortunately, nearly everyone lies, especially when facing possible trouble from the authorities. Sometimes you can infer why they’re lying, but it’s hard to reliably discern motive or get at the facts they’re working to obscure. This sense doesn’t tell you what they’re lying about, specifically, or see through their lies to the truth.</p><p class="s2 c2">Not all lies are verbal. You can tell when a person is attempting to project a false impression through body language.</p><p class="s2 c2">Certain individuals may be so adept at lying that they never set off your bullshit detector. Some people believe their own falsehoods. Psychopathic personality types lie reflexively and without shame, depriving you of the telltale tics and gestures you use to sense when a person is deceiving you. Sometimes you need leverage to get information out of people who you know are lying – re-interviewing suspects in the light of additional facts is a genre staple.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh20"/><span id="b18"/>Bureaucracy (Interpersonal)</h3><p class="s2 c2">You know how to navigate a bureaucratic organization, whether it’s a governmental office or a large business concern.

You can:</p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">convince officials to provide sensitive information</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">gain credentials on false pretences</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">find the person who really knows what’s going on</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">locate offices and files</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">borrow equipment or supplies</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Bureaucracy is not a catch-all information gathering ability. Bureaucrats wish to convey the impression that they are busy and harried, whether or not they actually are. Most take a profound, secret joy in directing inquiries elsewhere. When players attempt to use Bureaucracy to gain information more easily accessible via other abilities (such as Research), their contacts snidely advise them to do their own damn legwork.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh21"/>Camping (Technical)</h3><p class="s2 c2">You are familiar with working and living outdoors and in the wild.

You are comfortable with “old money” aristocracy, with the Davos elite, with the televised chattering classes, and with the crassest of nouveau riche vulgarians and celebutantes. Yachts, Gulfstreams, and three-star restaurants are your seeming natural habitat. You can:</p><p class="s2 s25"><span class="c16"></span><span class="c1">dress fashionably for any occasion</span></p><p class="s2 s25"><span class="c16"></span><span class="c1">get past the velvet rope at exclusive clubs and parties, or past the concierge at a four-star hotel</span></p><p class="s2 s25"><span class="c16"></span><span class="c1">drop brand names, allude to current trends, and generally blend in culturally with rich scenesters of all types</span></p><p class="s2 s25"><span class="c16"></span><span class="c1">identify the best wine, liquor, food, jewelry, and other luxury goods</span></p><p class="s2 s25"><span class="c16"></span><span class="c1">successfully schmooze for an introduction to, e.g., a celebrity, elected official, or financier</span></p><p class="s2 s25"><span class="c16"></span><span class="c1">recall specific or relevant gossip or news about the tastes, lifestyles, or sordid behavior of a rich or famous person</span></p><p class="s2 s25"><span class="c16"></span><span class="c1">know where and when the best parties, most culturally important openings, or other gala events in any city are due to happen</span></p><p class="s2 s25"><span class="c16"></span><span class="c1">score drugs or otherwise find the seamy side (if any) of high-society functions, happening nightclubs, etc.</span></p><p class="s2 s25"><span class="c16"></span><span class="c1">interact with the rich and famous as an accepted equal</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Note that this ability does not necessarily convey any actual wealth or fame.

Brief voice-only mimicry requires a spend of at least 1.</p><p class="s2 c2">Face-to-face impersonation requires a spend of at least 2 to 3 points for every five minutes of sustained contact between you and the object of your impersonation. Especially wary or intelligent subjects cost more to hoodwink than dull-witted walk-on characters.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh43"/>Inspiration (Interpersonal)</h3><p class="s2 s5 c2">You convince reluctant witnesses to supply information by appealing to their better selves.

This must take place in an official setting, where the subject is confined or feels under threat of confinement, and recognizes your authority (whether real or feigned.)</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh45"/><span id="b37"/>Intimidation (Interpersonal)</h3><p class="s2 c2">You elicit cooperation from suspects by seeming physically imposing, invading their personal space, and adopting a psychologically commanding manner. Intimidation may involve implied or direct threats of physical violence but is just as often an act of mental dominance.

You may specify these when you create your character, or choose opportunistically in the course of play, revealing that you just happen to speak Javanese when circumstances require it. You are not learning the language spontaneously but revealing a hitherto unmentioned fact about your character. You may elect to be literate in an ancient language which is no longer spoken.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh47"/><span id="b39"/>Law (Academic)</h3><p class="s2 c2">You are familiar with the criminal and civil laws of your home jurisdiction, and broadly acquainted with foreign legal systems.

(You can also find convenient windows to jimmy or coal-cellar doors to force, if need be.) Many locks require specialized tools, possession of which without a locksmith’s license is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. Very complex or tricky locks may require spends to open them speedily, to avoid noise or damage, or to relock afterward.</p><p class="s2 c2">Using Locksmith is, in other words, a way to gather clues. A lock that won’t open is like a witness that won’t talk or a bloodstain you can’t find: antithetical to mystery-solving, investigative-adventure design. Only safes, bank vaults, and the like – locks that exist to drive drama or conflict, rather than locks which merely hold clues — require actual tests against Difficulty.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh50"/><span id="b41"/>Natural History (Academic)</h3><p class="s2 c2">You study the evolution, behavior, and biology of plants and animals. You can:</p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">tell when an animal is behaving strangely</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">tell whether an animal or plant is natural to a given area</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">identify an animal from samples of its hair, blood, bones or other tissue</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">identify a plant from a small sample</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh51"/><span id="b42"/>Negotiation (Interpersonal)</h3><p class="s2 c2">You are an expert in making deals with others, convincing them that the best arrangement for you is also the best for them.

This ability does not allow you to work magic or summon supernatural entities. Doing either of these things is bad, the work of Esoterrorists. It weakens the fabric of reality and warps the practitioner’s psyche. You can, at best, fake your way through a ritual while attempting to pass yourself off as a believer. Even in this situation, your actions do not evoke supernatural effects. Your covertly hostile presence may, in fact, be enough to prevent an Esoterror ritual from achieving efficacy.</p><p class="s2 c2">As mentioned earlier, all characters built for the Esoterrorist setting get Occult Studies 1 for free.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh53"/>Oral History (Interpersonal)</h3><p class="s2 s5 c2">You can find sources willing to talk, win their confidence, and gather (usually lengthy) oral testimony about historical events, local traditions, folklore, family legend, or gossip. This is an excellent way to do research in illiterate or semi-literate societies, and in rural or small-town communities in general. This ability also covers taking shorthand notes or making recordings without spooking your sources.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh54"/><span id="b44"/>Pathology (Academic)</h3><p class="s2 c2">You are trained in carrying out medical examinations of living human subjects and forming diagnoses based on your findings.

You’re as comfortable with a card catalog and fiche reader as with an Internet search engine. The contacts file on your personal digital assistant brims with phone numbers of exotic and useful contacts.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh58"/>Respect (Interpersonal)</h3><p class="s2 c2">Your knowledge of social rituals allows you to gain information and favors with a culturally appropriate show of respect for a subject. This ability applies to subjects who consider themselves figures of authority, or who hold real or imagined power over you. By showing respect, you preserve your status as well as the subject’s.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh59"/><span id="b48"/>Streetwise (Interpersonal)</h3><p class="s2 c2">You know how to behave among crooks, gang-bangers, druggies, hookers and other habitués of the criminal underworld.

Here are two examples.]</span></p><h4 class="c2">Analytic Taste</h4><p class="s2 c2">Your sense of taste is superhuman, and you have, by trial and error, trained yourself to use it as a precision instrument. You function as a walking, talking chemical analysis lab, able to instantly detect the composition of nearly any object you can touch your tongue to. By distinguishing fine gradations of taste, you can, for example, match a sample of heroin to the precise batch it came from, or conduct a comparative analysis of soil samples. Although you may for good reason be reluctant to do so, you can even identify blood types from small samples, or derive similar identifying or typing information from other bodily fluids.</p><p class="s2 c2">Some individuals with analytic taste suffer from high revulsion thresholds and can only enjoy the purest, most perfect foods. Others become inured to traditional pleasures associated with the sense of taste, or become passionate connoisseurs of substances ordinary people consider inedible.</p><p class="s2 c2">When using this sense, you consume, at most, only trace quantities of the substances you test. Analytic taste grants no ability to digest inedible matter.</p><p class="s2 c2">Although this power grants no poison immunity, only the most toxic of substances will harm you in the tiny trace quantities required for analysis.</p><p class="s2 s5"><span class="c5">{From Mutant City Blues]</span></p><h4 class="c2">Aura Reading</h4><p class="s2 s5 c2">To those with the sight to see, every living organism is surrounded by a nimbus of energy.

Some investigative abilities tie into specific general abilities and vice versa; make sure you either include both relevant abilities, or drop the cross-references between them.]</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">Almost every General ability has a </span><span class="c6">cherry,</span><span class="c1"> a feature that kicks in when the character has 8 rating points or more in it. Agents can always use that special benefit, even if their pool in that ability has dropped to 0.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c5">Some GUMSHOE iterations, including Night’s Black Agents, permit the following:]</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">Many General abilities also function as </span><span class="c6">Investigative</span><span class="c1"> abilities, either when used to gather a clue (rather than to overcome opposition) or to interact with people devoted to those abilities’ use: Hand-to-Hand, for example, can be used investigatively to infiltrate a dojo or gymnasium, and to gather information or gossip from the clientele or managers.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">[</span><span class="c5">Some GUMSHOE games, like Ashen Stars, maintain a tighter separation between investigative and general abilities, so that the general Business Affairs ability, used to keep a crew’s finances humming, doesn’t garner you the clues you get from the investigative Forensic Accounting ability. To use this more restrictive approach, omit the above paragraph.]</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh66"/><span id="b52"/>Athletics</h3><p class="s2 c2">Athletics allows you to perform general acts of physical derring-do, from running to jumping to dodging falling or oncoming objects. Any physical action not covered by another ability, probably falls under the rubric of Athletics.</p><p class="s2 c2">If your Athletics rating is 8 or more, your Hit Threshold, the Target Number your opponents use when attempting to hit you in combat, is 4. Otherwise, your Hit Threshold is 3.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh67"/>Business Affairs</h3><p class="s2 c2">You know how to run a profitable business. </p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh68"/>Conceal</h3><p class="s2 c2">You can hide things from view and conceal them from search. Your methods might include camouflage, holding items out on your person, snaking things into drawers unobserved, building secret compartments, or even altering a thing’s visual signature with paint or plaster. </p><p class="s2 s5 c2">This ability also allows you to discover things intentionally concealed.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh69"/>Disguise</h3><p class="s2 c2">This is the skill of altering your own appearance, posture, and voice to be unrecognizable. Disguising others in anything more complex than a baseball cap or false mustache is good only for brief periods, as posture and body language are vital components in any successful disguise.</p><p class="s2 c2">This ability also covers selling yourself as a different person: vocal mannerisms, altered body language, dress and motion sense, and realistic-seeming reactions.</p><p class="s2 s5 c2">Successfully disguising yourself as an actual person already known to those you’re interacting with is extraordinarily difficult. Brief voice-only mimicry pits you against a Difficulty of 4. Face-to-face impersonation requires a successful roll against a Difficulty of 7 for every five minutes of sustained contact between you and the object of your impersonation.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh70"/><span id="b53"/>Driving</h3><p class="s2 c2">You’re a skilled defensive driver, capable of wringing high performance from even the most recalcitrant automobile, pick-up truck, or van. You can:</p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">evade or conduct pursuit</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">avoid collisions, or minimize damage from collisions</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">spot tampering with a vehicle</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">conduct emergency repairs</span></p><p class="s2 c2">For every additional rating point in Driving, you may add an additional vehicle type to your repertoire. These include: motorcycle, transport truck, helicopter, or airplane. You may choose exotic types, like hovercrafts and tanks, although these are unlikely to see regular use in an investigation-based game.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh71"/>Explosives</h3><p class="s2 c2">You’re an expert in bombs and booby-traps. You can:</p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">defuse bombs and traps</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">handle nitroglycerine or other dangerously unstable materials with relative safety</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">given time, blow open safes or vaults without damaging the contents</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">mix explosive compounds from common chemicals</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">safely construct and detonate explosive devices or booby-traps of your own</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Explosives doubles as an investigative ability when used to:</p><p class="s2 s22"><span class="c14">•</span><span class="c1">reconstruct exploded bombs</span></p><p class="s2 s5"><span class="c18">•</span><span class="c1">for any bomb (exploded or unexploded), determine the method and materials of the bomb-maker, and deduce his sophistication, background, and skill</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh72"/><span id="b54"/>Filch</h3><p class="s2 c2">Your nimble fingers allow you to unobtrusively manipulate small objects. You can:</p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c17">•</span><span class="c1">pilfer clues from a crime scene under the very noses of unsuspecting authorities</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c17">•</span><span class="c1">pick pockets</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c17">•</span><span class="c1">plant objects on unsuspecting subjects</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh73"/>Fleeing</h3><p class="s2 c2">Although you are not a strong overall athlete, you can boot it like a bat out of hell when chased by dangerous people, beings, or moving objects.</p><p class="s2 c2">If your Fleeing rating is more than twice your final Athletics rating, you can buy rating points in Fleeing above the value at a reduced rate, getting 2 rating points for each build point spent. Hence, if your Athletics rating is 0, all your Fleeing is half-price.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh74"/>Gambling</h3><p class="s2 c2">You are conversant with the rules and etiquette of all forms of gambling, from Texas hold ‘em and roulette to horse racing and numbers rackets. To win (or strategically lose) at a game of chance or sporting flutter requires a Gambling test, or a contest if played against an NPC with the Gambling ability. In addition to playing by the rules and winning, you can:</p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">spot cheating, either by the house or by another player</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">stack a deck, rig a horse race, load dice, or otherwise cheat</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Palming cards, tiles, or dice is allowed as a Gambling test; anything else requires Conceal or Filch.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">Gambling doubles as an</span><span class="c6"> Investigative</span><span class="c1"> ability when used to:</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">calculate the odds of events ruled by probabilities</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">use Bullshit Detector on professional gamblers despite their poker faces</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">interact with gamblers and blend in at casinos</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh75"/><span id="b55"/>Health</h3><p class="s2"><span class="c1">Health measures your ability to sustain injuries, resist infection, and survive the effects of toxins</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote1" id="footnote-ref1"><span class="c20"><sup>1</sup></span></a><span class="c1">. When you get hit in the course of a fight, your Health pool is diminished. A higher Health pool allows you to stay in a fight longer before succumbing to your injuries.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">When your Health pool is depleted, you may be dazed, wounded, or pushing up the daisies. For more on this, see “</span><span class="c4">Exhaustion, Injury and Gruesome Death</span><span class="c1">.”</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh76"/>Hypnosis</h3><p class="s2"><span class="c1">This ability represents medical hypnosis as depicted in pulpy genre sources; it is not psychic mesmerism or Dr Caligari-style mind control. You can only hypnotize a </span><span class="c5">willing</span><span class="c1"> subject, and only one subject at a time. Using Hypnosis requires a Test against a Difficulty Number that varies depending on what you are using it for. </span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">• </span><span class="c5">Simple hypnotic state:</span><span class="c1"> To place a patient in a hypnotic trance, you must succeed against Difficulty 3. During this trance, she is calm and placid.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">• </span><span class="c5">Establish analytic rapport:</span><span class="c1"> Once you have successfully hypnotized a patient, your Psychoanalysis pool increases by 3 during any future use of Psychoanalysis on them. Your Psychoanalysis rating must be at least 3 to gain this benefit, and the 3 points must be spent on the patient.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">• </span><span class="c5">Recover memories:</span><span class="c1"> The patient’s fragmented or buried memories, as of dreams, traumas, or murky monster attacks, can be called to the surface and “relived.” This is a Difficulty 4 test. Reliving an experience that cost Stability will cost the patient the same amount again, although you may practice immediate Psychological Triage to minimize the patient’s shock. The GM is free to provide false memories if she feels you are “leading the witness.”</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">• </span><span class="c5">Post-hypnotic suggestion:</span><span class="c1"> Upon lifting the trance, you may cause your patient to perform a single action without apparent thought. You may require a “trigger phrase” or simply specify a time: (“When you get home, you’ll leave the book on the desk.”) Spells and other complex activities cannot be post-hypnotically induced. The patient will not accept a suggestion contrary to her normal behavior. This is a Difficulty 4 or higher test; the GM may increase the Difficulty based on the suggestion.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">• </span><span class="c5">Ease pain:</span><span class="c1"> You can relieve symptomatic pain in a patient. This removes the mechanical penalties for being hurt and lasts until the patient is wounded again. This is a Difficulty 4 or higher test; the GM may increase the Difficulty depending on the pain’s severity. </span><span class="c5">This does not work under battlefield conditions.</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">• </span><span class="c5">False memories:</span><span class="c1"> You can purposely implant false memories in the patient or bury real ones. This is extremely unethical without a direct therapeutic benefit (such as easing a remembered trauma). This is a Contest between your Hypnosis and the patient’s Stability. Your Difficulty Number is 5; the patient resists with Difficulty 4. Again, the GM may increase your Difficulty based on the severity of the memory change. At the GM’s discretion, if the patient suffers a further trauma (such as her Stability dropping below -5 again), she may suddenly recall the truth.</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh77"/><span id="b56"/>Infiltration</h3><p class="s2 c2">You’re good at placing yourself inside places you have no right to be. You can:</p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">pick locks</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">deactivate or evade security systems</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">move silently</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">find suitable places for forced entry, and use them</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Despite its name, Infiltration is as useful for getting out of places undetected as if its for getting into them.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh78"/><span id="b57"/>Mechanics</h3><p class="s2 c2">You’re good at building, repairing, and disabling devices, from classic pit-and-pendulum traps to DVD players. Given the right components, you can create jury-rigged devices from odd bits of scrap. Mechanics doubles as an investigative ability when used to:</p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">evaluate the quality of workmanship used to create an item</span></p><p class="s2 s21"><span class="c13">•</span><span class="c1">determine the identity of a handmade item’s maker by comparing to known work by that individual</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[You may wish to maintain the flavor of certain settings by splitting this into multiple disciplines, each specializing in its own particular subset of technology.] </span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh79"/><span id="b58"/>Medic</h3><p class="s2 c2">You can perform first aid on sick or injured individuals. For more on the use of this ability, see “Exhaustion, Injury, and Death.”</p><p class="s2 c2">If you have 8 or more points in Medic, you get 1 point in Pathology.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh80"/>Piloting</h3><p class="s2 c2">You can fly one or more airborne vehicles. You can:</p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">evade or conduct pursuit</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">anticipate bad weather</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">avoid collisions, or minimize damage from collisions</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">spot tampering with a vehicle</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">navigate by compass or the stars, read maps, and maintain a sense of direction</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">conduct emergency repairs</span></p><p class="s2 s5"><span class="c5">[You may require the player to specify a particular type of craft, gaining 1 vehicle per 2 rating points.

In some settings you might include water craft in this ability.]</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh81"/><span id="b59"/>Preparedness</h3><p class="s2 c2">You expertly anticipate the needs of any mission by packing a kit efficiently arranged with necessary gear. Assuming you have immediate access to your kit, you can produce whatever object the team needs to overcome an obstacle. You make a simple test; if you succeed, you have the item you want. You needn’t do this in advance of the adventure, but can dig into your kit bag (provided you’re able to get to it) as the need arises.</p><p class="s2 c2">Items of obvious utility to a paranormal investigation do not require a test. These include but are not limited to: note paper, writing implements, laptop computer, a PDA with wireless Internet access, mini USB drive, cell phone, various types of tape, common tools and hardware, light weapons, flashlights of various sizes, chem lights, batteries, magnifying glasses, thermometer, and a no-frills audio recording device.</p><p class="s2 c2">The utility of traditional anti-supernatural accoutrements such as crucifixes, holy water, and silver bullets is a matter of great debate within the Ordo Veritatis. Whether you choose to include them in your basic kit reveals your attitude toward the supernatural. Is it purely the work of the Esoterrorists, or are there other unnatural forces out there? Decide for yourself, and pack wisely.</p><p class="s2 c2">Other abilities imply the possession of basic gear suitable to their core tasks. Characters with Medic have their own first aid kits; Photographers come with cameras and accessories. If you have Shooting, you have a gun, and so on. Preparedness does not intrude into their territory. It covers general-purpose investigative equipment, plus oddball items that suddenly come in handy in the course of the story.</p><p class="s2 c2">The sorts of items you can produce at a moment’s notice depend not on your rating or pool, but on narrative credibility. If the GM determines that your possession of an item would seem ludicrous or and/or out of genre, you don’t get to roll for it. You simply don’t have it. Any item which elicits a laugh from the group when suggested is probably out of bounds.</p><p class="s2 c2">Inappropriate use of the Preparedness ability is like pornography. Your GM will know it when she sees it.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh82"/>Public Relations</h3><p class="s2 c2">You manage the public image of your team or others. You unruffle feathers, burnish reputations, downplay failures, and trumpet successes. </p><p class="s2 c2">When keeping the locals onside during a case, the GM may allow you to spend Reassurance or Respect points on Public Relations tests. </p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh83"/>Riding</h3><p class="s2 c2">Although staying on a tame, untroubled walking horse (on flattish terrain, anyway) is relatively easy once one gets the hang of it, and staying on a mule or burro even easier, you are a gifted equestrian. You can gallop even recalcitrant or spirited horses, donkeys, and mules past distractions and across the countryside. You can:</p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">evade or conduct mounted pursuit</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">care for, groom, shoe, and stable mounts</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">take care of, prepare, and use riding gear such as saddles and bridles</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">calm a nervous mount</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">drive a horse-drawn wagon or cart</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">wield a weapon while riding</span></p><p class="s2 s5 c2">For every additional 2 rating points in Riding, you may add an additional riding animal: camel, water buffalo, or elephant.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh84"/><span id="b60"/>Scuffling</h3><p class="s2 c2">You can hold your own in a hand-to-hand fight, whether you wish to kill, knock out, restrain, or evade your opponent.</p><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[To preserve the flavor of certain settings you may wish to break this out into two abilities, for armed and unarmed close combat.]</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh85"/><span id="b61"/>Sense Trouble</h3><p class="s2 c2">Keen perceptions allow you to spot signs of potential danger to yourself and others. Information gained from this ability might save your skins but doesn’t directly advance the central mystery. You might use it to:</p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">hear someone sneak up on you</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">see an obscured or hidden figure</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">smell a gas leak</span></p><p class="s2 s23"><span class="c15"></span><span class="c1">have a bad feeling about this</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Players never know the Difficulty Numbers for Sense Trouble before deciding how many points to spend, even in games where GMs generously inform the players of other Difficulty Numbers. Players must blindly choose how much to spend. </p><p class="s2 c2">When more than one player is able to make a Sense Trouble test, the group decides which of them makes the attempt. Only one attempt per source of trouble occurs, conducted by the chosen PC. </p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh86"/><span id="b62"/>Shrink</h3><p class="s2 c2">You can provide comfort, perspective and solace to the mentally troubled. You may be a therapist or counselor, a priest or pastor, or just a empathetic and intuitive individual. You can restore panicked characters to a state of calm, and treat any long-term mental illnesses they accrue in the course of their investigations.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh87"/><span id="b63"/>Shooting</h3><p class="s2 c2">You are adept with firearms.</p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh88"/><span id="b64"/>Stability</h3><p class="s2 c2">Jarring or stressful events can exert a damaging long- psychological toll.

You hit your target on a successful Blood Spray test. If you hit, the opponent must make an Athletics test, the Difficulty of which equals 4 plus any Blood Spray points you spent on the attack. If he fails the test, he is knocked over and must, in lieu of his next attack, make an Athletics test (against the same Difficulty) in order to regain his footing. If he fails, he continues to slip on the blood, losing further attacks until he finally succeeds.</p><p class="s2 c2">A blood spray attack inspires instinctive revulsion. Anyone within direct visual range must make a Stability test or suffer the urge to flee. Victims with the Olfactory Center power add your Blood Spray pool to the Difficulty of this test. </p><p class="s2 c2">Characters who do not flee suffer ill effects while they remain able to see and smell your blood: their Hit Thresholds decrease by 1, and the Hit Thresholds of anyone they’re attempting to attack effectively increases by 1.</p><p class="s2 c2">In addition to any Blood Spray points you spend, each use of this power costs you 3 Health points. Health points lost to Blood Spray use can be refreshed with a large meal of red meat, washed down with large quantities of orange juice or a similarly sugary drink, followed by an hour’s nap.</p><p class="s2 s5"><span class="c5">[From Mutant City Blues]</span></p><h4 class="c2">Pathway Amplification</h4><p class="s2 c2">You can heighten another mind’s ability to recall, process and interpret information. Once per episode, you may designate a PC recipient and an investigative ability that character possesses. The PC adds your Pathway Amplification rating to his pool in that ability. The pool refreshes to normal at the case’s conclusion.</p><p class="s2 s5"><span class="c5">[From Ashen Stars]</span></p><h4 class="c2"><span id="b66"/>Viroware Enhancement: Dominator</h4><p class="s2 s5 c2">You emit pheromones provoking the instinct of intelligent beings to obey high-status individuals in a social hierarchy. When an interaction with a supporting character has turned against you, spend 4 points from your Bureaucracy, Cop Talk, Downside, Interrogation, and/or Intimidation pools. The GM then plays the character, subtly or overtly, as if you have gained the upper hand. The subject must be within 4m of you when you first initiate the effect. </p><p class="s2 s5"><span class="c5">[From Ashen Stars]</span></p><h4 class="c2">Cherries</h4><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[In some games, you may wish to trick out general abilities with the following fillip:]</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">Almost every General ability has a cherry, a feature that kicks in when the character has 8 rating points or more in it. Agents can always use that special benefit, even if their pool in that ability</span><span class="c5"> </span><span class="c1">has dropped to 0.</span></p><p class="s28"><span class="c23">Example Cherry: Crackers’ Crypto</span></p><p class="s2 s5 c2">If your Digital Intrusion rating is 8 or more, you get 1 free rating point in the Investigative ability Cryptography. You can also encrypt your team’s electronic communications against all but government-level (NSA, GCHQ, MID, DGSE, GRU, Unit 8200, etc.) cracking.</p><p class="s2 s5"><span class="c1">[From </span><span class="c5">Night’s Black Agents</span><span class="c1">]</span></p><h3 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh91"/>Potential Points</h3><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[Useful in some settings; best when restricted to one, or a few, abilities you wish to highlight.]</span></p><p class="s2 c2">Some abilities are more abstruse, difficult, or complex than others, enough so that they can’t simply be bought “from scratch” during character improvement. They require a prerequisite: teaching by a master, learning from an ancient text, or some other specific in-game experience. That prerequisite experience conveys “potential points” in the ability; when the character spends build points from experience on that ability, she can only do so up to her “potential.”</p><h2 class="c8"><span id="chapter-4-sh92"/>Drives</h2><p class="s2"><span class="c5">[In some games you may wish to require players to select drives for their characters, ensuring that their characters are well motivated to get into the kinds of investigative trouble the genre demands.]</span></p><p class="s2"><span class="c1">Each PC follows a </span><span class="c6">drive</span><span class="c1">, a personal motivation giving him, her or it good reason to act heroically and curiously. By following your drive, you keep the story moving and ensure that your behavior is in keeping with the [</span><span class="c5">insert</span><span class="c1"> </span><span class="c5">name of genre</span><span class="c1">] genre.</span></p><h4 class="c2">Sample Drive: Altruism</h4><p class="s2 s5 c2">You instinctively act for the benefit of others, especially when they’re unable to help themselves. As far as you’re concerned, the fees the crew earns for its cases are just a means to an end. They keep the ship operational and the group sufficiently equipped to go out and do good in the world. If the Combine were still active, you might well have signed on with them as a patrol officer. Without them, the need for strong men and women to act selflessly is greater than ever. This sector of space has taken some hard knocks, and people are scared and discouraged. But if enough folks put the common good over their own petty interests, someday—maybe someday soon—the Bleed will go back to what it was before the war.</p><p class="s2 s5"><span class="c5">[From Ashen Stars]</span></p></div></body></html>
