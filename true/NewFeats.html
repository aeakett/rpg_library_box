<h1>CHAPTER 3: FEATS</h1>

<p>
Feats determine a hero's special abilities.  This section expands the selection of feats available to heroes, including some new arcane feats and feats granting arcane abilities. Narrators should feel free to allow players to choose from these feats for their heroes as their roles and advancement permit. 
</p>

<p>
Some of the feats in this section use the advanced rules for arcana found in Chapter III. Consult those rules for further information on using these feats. 
</p>

<h3>Aggravate (General)</h3>

<p>
You tend to attract an enemy's attention. As a standard action, you can make a Bluff check against your target's Sense Motive check or Will saving throw, whichever has the higher bonus. If you succeed, your target must attack you next round, if it is possible to do so. Targets get a +1 on their check or save for each time, atter the first, this feat is used against them in the same encounter (successful or not). 
</p>

<p>
A target not already engaged in combat can make a Will saving throw (in addition to the Sense Motive check or Will save to resist the feat). If successful, the target shows enough restraint to attack you verbally, not physically. Targets engaged in combat (with you or someone else) do not get this save. 
</p>

<p>
You can take this feat a second time (Improved Aggravate), allowing you to make the Bluff check as a move action, rather than a standard action. 
</p>

<h3>Arcane Expertise (Arcane)</h3>

<p>
Choose one or two arcana in which you are trained. If you choose one, you gain +3 ranks with that arcanum. If you choose two, you gain +2 ranks in each. You gain all the normal benefits of your increased arcana ranks. 
</p>

<p>
You can only apply the benefits of this feat once to any given arcanum (whether a 2 or 3 rank increase). Each time you take this feat, you must select different arcana. 
</p>

<h3>Attunement of Art (Arcane)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisite: Adept level 3 
</p>

<p>
When attuning a single Item of Art (see <a href="#">Arcane Items</a>), you may reduce the effective rating of the item by your Wisdom or Intelligence (your choice). This may not reduce an item below half of its normal rating, and you may not have more than one item bound through this feat at a time. 
</p>

<p>
You may purchase this feat multiple times. Each time, you may attune an additional item with it. 
</p>

<h3>Attunement of Skill (Expert)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisite: Expert level 3 
</p>

<p>
When attuning a single Item of Skill (see <a href="#">Arcane Items</a>), you may reduce the effective level of the item by your Dexterity or Charisma (your choice).

<p>
Prerequisite: Warrior level 3 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Prerequisite: Wealth +1 
</p>

</p>

<p>
Prerequisites: Sneak rank 10, Perform (dance) rank 2 
</p>

<p>
You are skilled at using optical tricks to make yourself seem to be where you are not. You can take a move action to obscure your exact position.

</p>

<p>
Prerequisites: Leadership, Reputation +3 
</p>

</p>

<p>
Your unit has a Reputation score. When you take the Commission feat, that score is set at 2 less than your current Reputation. Members of the unit, including yourself, making a Reputation check may substitute the unit score for their own. 
</p>

<p>
The unit's Reputation increases or decreases according to the unit's actions. Each time the unit accomplishes a notable deed -- a great victory, a great loss, a feat never before achieved -- the unit's Reputation increases by 1. Every six game months that pass without the unit accomplishing a notable deed decreases the unit's Reputation by 1. 
</p>

<p>
Once per game month, you may spend a Conviction point and make an inspiring speech to the unit as a whole. For the next day, each member of the unit gains a bonus to attack rolls and Will saves equal to half the unit's Reputation score.

</p>

An Elemental Strike inflicts damage equal to half your arcanum rank, rounded down. Water and Wind Shaping strikes inflict nonlethal damage. If you apply the Widen Arcana feat to an Elemental Strike, targets can make a Reflex saving throw (Difficulty 10 + the strike's damage bonus). If the save is successful, the strike's damage bonus is halved. 
</p>

<p>
Elemental Strike is fatiguing, with a fatigue save Difficulty of 10 + the strike's damage bonus. 
</p>

<h3>Elusive Target (Expert)</h3>

However, you can detach your followers from your estate and assign them to other duties once per game year for up to three game months.

</p>

</p>

<p>
Followers assigned to the castle staff cannot leave their duties for more than a few days at a time; however, you can detach your followers from the castle and assign them to other duties once per game year for up to six game months. While your followers are detached, your quarterly Diplomacy checks have their Difficulty increased by 5 (current Wealth score + 10). 
</p>

<p>
Your assistance is particularly valuable. When you make a check to aid someone (see <a href="Introduction.html#Introduction - Aiding Another">Aiding Another</a> in the core rules), you may choose a higher Difficulty for the check and provide your companion with a greater bonus. Some Difficulties require you to reach a certain level before you can choose them.

</table>

<ul>
  <li> Leadership Score: Your base leadership score is your total level plus your Charisma. In order to take into account negative Charisma scores, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but you must still be 6th level or higher to acquire the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect leadership score, as detailed above. 
  <li> Companion Level: You can attract a companion of up to this level. Regardless of your leadership score, you can only recruit a companion two or more levels lower than your total level. You can try to attract a companion of a particular background, role, and alignment, but you take a leadership score penalty if you recruit a companion of an alignment different from your own. 
  <li> Number of Followers by Level: You can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to a companion, except they're generally low-level. When your hero attains a new level, consult the leadership table above to determine if the hero acquires more followers, some of which may be higher level than the existing followers. 
</ul>

<h3>Light Sleeper (General)</h3>

<p>
You do not suffer the +10 Difficulty modifier to Notice checks for being asleep. This means you're much less likely to be caught by surprise while sleeping. You can also act normally immediately upon waking. Other characters are normally dazed for one round atter waking (taking no actions, but defending normally). 
</p>

<h3>Lightning Call (Arcane)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisite: Weather Shaping 
</p>

<p>
You can call down bolts of lightning from storms (natural or summoned by Weather Shaping). Each round, you can take a full-round action to call and direct a bolt of lightning. It lances down from the clouds to strike a chosen target in your line of sight. The bolt inflicts damage equal to your adept level. The target can make a Reflex saving throw (Difficulty 10 + half your adept level, rounded down) to halve the damage. 
</p>

<p>
Calling lightning is fatiguing (save Difficulty equal to 10 + half the bolt's damage, rounded up). Each successive bolt called in the same encounter increases the Difficulty of the fatigue save by +1. 
</p>

<h3>Low Profile (General)</h3>

<p>
You're less well known than you might be. Reduce your Reputation score by 3 each time you acquire this feat. Your Reputation cannot decrease below +0. 
</p>

<h3>Master Elementalist (Arcane)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisites: Charisma +3, Knowledge (arcana) rank 9, Summon Elemental 
</p>

<p>
You are skilled at cajoling the spirits of the elements into manifesting and serving you. A summoned elemental remains in your service for one hour per adept level you possess, rather than the normal one round per level. 
</p>

<h3>Menacing (General)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisite: Untrained in Diplomacy and Gather Information 
</p>

<p>
You frighten people. You may add half your Reputation score to your Intimidate checks. If you ever gain Diplomacy or Gather Information as a known skill, you lose your menacing edge and the benefit of this feat. 
</p>

<h3>Mind Over Body (General)</h3>

<p>
You can exert great mental control over your body. When you make Constitution checks, you can substitute your Wisdom score for your Constitution score, so long as you are conscious. 
</p>

<h3>Organized (General)</h3>

<p>
You perform tasks quickly. You may make a Wisdom check (Difficulty 15) to organize a task requiring a skill check and taking more than one round. This task may be performed by you or another character under your guidance. If you succeed at the check, the task is completed in half the usual time. 
</p>

<h3>Perfect Recall (General)</h3>

<p>
You have perfect recall of everything you've experienced. You have a +4 bonus on all checks to remember things, including saving throws against effects that alter or erase memories. Your head for trivia allows you to make any Knowledge skill check untrained, meaning you can answer questions requiring even difficult or obscure knowledge you may have read, seen, or heard before. 
</p>

<h3>Prone Fighting (General)</h3>

<p>
You suffer no penalties on your attack rolls for being prone, and opponents do not gain any bonus to hit you with melee attacks while you are prone. Opponents making ranged attacks against you still have -4 on their attack rolls. You can crawl at half your speed rather than the usual 5-feet per move action. 
</p>

<h3>Psychic Reflection (General)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisite: Psychic Shield rank 9 
</p>

<p>
You can reflect psychic arcana back at their originator. When your Psychic Shield successfully blocks a psychic arcanum directed at you, you can make another Psychic Shield check against the attacker's check. If you succeed, the psychic arcanum directed at you affects the attacker instead, using the attacker's bonus. You do not suffer any fatigue for the reflected arcanum (the attacker does), but you are in control of the effect, even if you are not trained in the arcanum. You must maintain the arcanum yourself (if necessary), and it has its normal effect and duration. The attacker may defend and save against the reflected arcanum normally but cannot also reflect it using Psychic Reflection. Any attempt to do so simply causes the arcanum's effect to dissipate. 
</p>

<h3>Psychic Trap (General)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisite: Trained in Psychic Shield 
</p>

<p>
You can psychically act against anyone who tries to overcome your psychic defenses. When an opponent attempts to use a psychic arcanum against you and fails to overcome your Psychic Shield, you get an immediate psychic arcanum use against that opponent as a reaction. This can be any psychic arcanum you can use as a standard or move action, but not a full-round action. If the arcanum requires mental contact, you are considered in mental contact with your opponent for the purposes of using it. You only get one free psychic arcanum use per opponent per round, regardless of the number of attempts to overcome your Psychic Shield. The reactive psychic arcanum has its normal Difficulty and fatigue. 
</p>

<h3>Reputation for Excellence (General)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisite: 6 ranks in chosen skill 
</p>

<p>
Your skill is respected by others. Choose a skill. For every three ranks you have in this skill, you gain a +1 bonus to your Reputation in situations where your expertise is relevant. 
</p>

<p>
You may choose this feat more than once. Each time you do, it is applied to a different skill. 
</p>

<h3>Ritualist (Arcane)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) rank 4, one arcane talent feat 
</p>

<p>
You have been trained in the techniques of arcane rituals, drawing upon the inherent power in rare items, specific times, and unique places. You are capable of creating rituals channeling no more &Eacute;lan than your adept level plus your Wisdom and Intelligence. You may use rituals that channel more &Eacute;lan should you find a written copy of the ritual or are taught it by another ritualist. See Arcane Rituals in Chapter III for more information. 
</p>

<h3>Quick Draw (General)</h3>

<p>
You can draw, ready, or reload a weapon as a free action, rather than as a move action. 
</p>

<h3>Renown (General)</h3>

<p>
You are well known, granting a +3 increase to your Reputation score. You can take this feat multiple times, gaining a +3 increase each time. 
</p>

<h3>Self-Shaping (Arcane)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisites: Meditative Talent, Body Control rank 12 
</p>

<p>
You can reshape your body to assume the form of another creature. The new form must be a humanoid or animal, with a level no greater than your total level. If you are slain or knocked unconscious while using this ability, you revert to your original form. You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also gain the new form's speed and qualities, and you retain your own base attack bonus, Defense, saving throws, and skills (modified by your new ability scores). 
</p>

<p>
You can freely designate the new form's cosmetic qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but must fall within the norms for the new form's species. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the species. If you use this ability to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check. 
</p>

<p>
Your equipment is not affected by the transformation. Any clothing or equipment that cannot be worn by your new form drops off. Likewise, when you return to your normal form, you have only what you are carrying or wearing. This usually leaves you naked if you were in animal form. 
</p>

<p>
Self-Shaping is fatiguing, with a fatigue save Difficulty of 15. It requires a full-round action to undergo a transformation, during which you can do nothing else. The transformation lasts for one hour per level, but you can make an additional fatigue save to maintain a form for another hour per level. 
</p>

<p>
Assuming an animal shape poses an additional danger: each hour you must make a Will saving throw (Difficulty 15) or lose a point of Intelligence. If your Intelligence score drops to the natural level for that animal (usually -4 or -5), you become that animal in mind, as well as body. The effect of your Self-Shaping becomes permanent, and your normal identity is lost. You remain trapped until someone else achieves a Difficulty 30 Mind Touch to reach and reawaken your normal self, allowing you to return to your normal form.
</p>

<p>
Note that rhydan using Self-Shaping can assume humanoid forms, and they are affected by assuming animal forms the same as anyone else. Some legendary rhydan mastered the ability to turn into humanoids, and even found humanoid lovers or mates, but most rhydan find humanoid forms clumsy, uncomfortable, and vulnerable (needing to wear clothing and armor, for example). 
</p>

<h3>Severance (Arcane)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisites: Psychic Talent, Ward rank 13 
</p>

<p>
You can remove another creature's arcane talents. You must be in mental contact with the subject. Make a Ward check (Difficulty 30) as a full-round action to deprive the subject of arcane talents. The target makes a Will saving throw against your arcanum. If the check succeeds and the Will save fails, the subject loses use of all arcane talents and arcana, while retaining knowledge of those abilities. The target gets an additional Will save each day to regain those abilities, and a use of Mind Shaping or another use of this feat can reverse the effect (Difficulty 30). Severance is fatiguing. You can take 10 on the Ward check if the target is helpless and unable to resist you, but you can't take 20. 
</p>

<h3>Skill Knack (General)</h3>

<p>
There are aspects of a skill that you excel at. Pick three tricks from the Skills section. You can choose your tricks from the same skill or from different skills, but the Difficulty of each trick must be no more than 10 greater than your skill bonus with the relevant skill. 
</p>

<p>
The tricks you choose become knacks. You can always take 10 with a knack, even in situations where you cannot normally take 10. If you want better results, you can also roll a skill check with a knack. If your die roll is less than 10, you are considered to have rolled a 10. 
</p>

<h3>Startle (General)</h3>

<p>
You can make an Intimidate check rather than a Bluff check to feint in combat (see <a href="Skills.html#Chapter 2: Skills - Bluff">Bluff</a> in the core rules). Targets can resist with Intimidate, Sense Motive, or Will and gain a +1 bonus on their resistance check per startle attempt against them in the same encounter. 
</p>

<h3>Stylish (General)</h3>

<p>
You may spend a Conviction point to apply half the purchase Difficulty of your clothing (round down) as a bonus to one Bluff, Diplomacy, or Gather Information check. 
</p>

<h3>Tireless (General)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisites: Constitution +1, Endurance 
</p>

<p>
You have tremendous energy reserves. You suffer no penalties from being winded or fatigued, although you still gain fatigue levels normally. This feat has no effect on exhaustion. 
</p>

<h3>Tireless Summoner (Arcane)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisites: Charisma +1, Summon Elemental or Summon Darkfiend 
</p>

<p>
You have great practice at shunting away the energy backlashes that normally cause exhaustion among summoners. Subtract your Charisma from the summoned creature's level when determining the Difficulty for the fatigue check of a summoning. 
</p>

<h3>Unbalance Opponent (Expert or Martial)</h3>

<p>
You are skilled at keeping opponents off balance. Each round, choose one opponent. That opponent's Strength does not apply to melee attack rolls to hit you, but does still apply to damage. You can select a new opponent each round or continue to keep the same one off balance. 
</p>

<h3>Weather Shaping (Arcane)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisites: Shaping Talent, trained in Water and Wind Shaping 
</p>

<p>
You can shape the complex forces controlling the weather. More than just commanding the winds, you can change the weather to suit your will. A use of Weather Shaping affects an area with a diameter in miles equal to your adept level, centered on you. 
</p>

<p>
It takes 10 minutes for the effects of Weather Shaping to manifest. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in. 
</p>

<p>
You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific effects of the weather -- where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. When you select a certain weather condition, the weather assumes that condition 10 minutes later, changing gradually over that time. The weather continues as you lett it for a number of hours equal to your adept level plus 4, or until you use a standard action to designate a new weather condition, which fully manifests 10 minutes later. Weather Shaping can do away with weather conditions (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them. 
</p>

<p>
Weather Shaping is fatiguing, with a save Difficulty of 17. Each change in weather counts as a use of this feat. 
</p>

<h3>Wellspring Adept (Arcane)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) rank 6, one arcane talent feat 
</p>

<p>
You know the techniques for drawing upon the power of wellsprings (see <a href="#">Places of Power</a>). You must be located in a wellspring to draw from it. Using arcana augmented by a wellspring is a full-round action and requires a Concentration check (Difficulty 10 + the power rating of the wellspring).
</p>

<p>
You can detect wellsprings at a distance equal to your adept level times 150 feet, with no penalty for distance. You have a +5 bonus on Second Sight checks to do so. 
</p>

<h3>Wellspring Master (Arcane)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) rank 10, Wellspring Adept 
</p>

<p>
Not only are you skilled at using the natural flows of power in a wellspring, but you are capable of attuning your spirit to that wellspring. 
</p>

<p>
Once attuned to a wellspring, you are treated as though you were constantly standing in the middle of its flows, allowing you to tap its energy and augment your arcana regardless of where you are. An arcanum can only be augmented by a single wellspring at a time. 
</p>

<p>
You may attune yourself to up to your adept level in wellsprings at one time. A wellspring may have any number of adepts attuned to it. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, with a Heart Reading, Nature Reading, or Object Reading check (Difficulty 10 + the power rating of the wellspring) you can determine how many people are attuned to a wellspring. If you personally know any of them, or have used Heart Reading or Mind Reading on them in the past, you can identify them. 
</p>

<h3>Windwalk (Arcane)</h3>

<p>
Prerequisites: Shaping Talent, trained in Wind Shaping 
</p>

<p>
With a successful Difficulty 30 Wind Shaping check, you can walk on air at a speed of 5 feet times your Wind Shaping rank, with perfect maneuverability. The effect ends when your feet next touch the ground. Windwalk is fatiguing (make the fatigue save when your use of this ability ends) and requires concentration (a free action each round) to maintain. If your concentration lapses for any reason, you fall. 
</p>

<p>
You can take 10 or take 20 on a Wind Shaping check for Windwalk. Taking 20 requires two minutes preparation and increases the fatigue save Difficulty by +20.
</p>
