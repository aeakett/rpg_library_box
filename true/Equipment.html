<h1>CHAPTER 5: EQUIPMENT</h1>

<p>
This chapter describes the various weapons, armor, tools, and other equipment heroes use in their adventures and daily lives. It also looks at handling wealth and spending for heroes.
</p>
<p>
Assume a True SRD hero owns at least one outfit of normal clothes, if not several. Pick one of the following outfits: artisan's outfit, entertainer's outfit, explorer's outfit, peasant's outfit, scholar's outfit, or traveler's outfit (see <a href="Equipment.html#Chapter 5: Equipment - Clothing">Clothing</a> later in this chapter). Other items and equipment are acquired using the character's Wealth score.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Wealth"></a>
<h2>Wealth</h2>

<p>
Heroes have a Wealth score, a trait reflecting their buying power, a composite of available cash, credit, and income. The Wealth score serves as the basis for Wealth checks, used to purchase goods and services.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Wealth Score"></a>
<h3>Wealth Score</h3>

<p>
A hero's starting Wealth score is +5 plus the hero's Charisma score. The Wealthy feat grants a +4 bonus. Over the course of play, the hero's Wealth score may decrease as the hero purchases expensive items and increase as the hero gains levels. A hero's Wealth score can never fall below +0, but there is no limit to how high the Wealth score can increase.
</p>
<p>
Since Wealth is an abstract concept, it's sometimes difficult to determine how financially well off a character is. To get a general sense of how wealthy a hero is, check the Wealth Score table.

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - The Wealth Check"></a>
<h3>The Wealth Check</h3>

<p>
Wealth checks are used to determine what you can afford and what goods and services you reasonably have access to. Wealth score reflects a hero's buying power. Every item has a purchase Difficulty, also called its cost. To purchase an item, make a Wealth check against the item's cost.
</p>
<p>
A Wealth check is a d20 roll plus your current Wealth score. If your check result equals or exceeds the cost of an item, you successfully purchase it. If you fail, you can't afford it at this time.
</p>
<p>
If your current Wealth score is equal to or greater than an item's cost, you automatically succeed. The cost is negligible for someone of your wealth. If your Wealth score is +0, you don't have the buying power to purchase anything with a cost of 10 or higher, and you can't take 10 or take 20 on Wealth checks because your cash flow is too unreliable.
</p>
<p>
If you successfully purchase something with a cost greater than your current
Wealth score, your Wealth score decreases (see <a href="Equipment.html#Chapter 5: Equipment - Losing Wealth">Losing Wealth</a> below for details).
</p>
<p>
Shopping and Time. Buying less common objects generally takes a number of hours equal to the cost, reflecting the time needed to locate the desired item and close the deal.
</p>
<p>
Taking 10 and Taking 20. You can usually take 10 or take 20 when making a Wealth check. Taking 20 requires 20 times as long as normal, meaning you're shopping around for the best deals.
</p>
<p>
Try Again? You can try again if you fail a Wealth check, but not until you have spent an additional number of hours shopping equal to the cost of the item.
</p>
<p>
Aid Another. One other character can make an aid another attempt to help someone else buy something. If the attempt is successful, you provide the other person with a +2 bonus on the Wealth check to buy that item. If the item's cost is above your current Wealthy, you also reduce your Wealth score by 1 to reflect the financial assistance you've given.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Losing Wealth"></a>
<h3>Losing Wealth</h3>

<p>
Any time you purchase something with a cost greater than your current Wealth score or something with a cost of 15 or higher, your Wealth score decreases. How much the Wealth score is reduced depends on how expensive the item is. Your Wealth score only goes down if you successfully buy something. If you attempt to buy something and fail, your Wealth score is unaffected.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th align="left"> Item Cost </th>
  <th align="left"> Wealth Decrease </th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left"> 15 or higher </td>
  <td align="left"> 1 point </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left"> 1-10 points higher than current Wealth score </td>
  <td align="left"> 1 point </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left"> 11-15 points higher than current Wealth score </td>
  <td align="left"> 2 points </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left"> 16 or more points higher than current Wealth Bonus </td>
  <td align="left"> 3 points </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Your Wealth score is always reduced by 1 point when you purchase something with a cost of 15 or higher, regardless of your Wealth score. This decrease is cumulative with any decrease that comes from your Wealth score being lower than an item's cost. For example, if your hero has a Wealth score of +10 and successfully purchases a noble's outfit (cost 16), her Wealth score would be reduced by 1 point for the cost being 15 or higher and by an additional point for the cost being 1-10 points higher than her Wealth score.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Gaining Wealth"></a>
<h3>Gaining Wealth</h3>

<p>
A hero typically gains Wealth when advancing in level, using his professional skill, or as a reward for accomplishing some quest.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Professional Skills"></a>
<h4>Professional Skills</h4>

<p>
Characters use their skills to earn a living. A skill used to earn Wealth is called a professional skill. The particular skill depends on the character's trade or profession. For example, a diplomat or courtier uses Diplomacy as a professional skill, while a smith or carpenter uses Craft, a con artist uses Bluff, a minstrel uses Perform, and so forth. Discuss with the Narrator what skill would be appropriate for your hero's profession, which can change, at the Narrator's discretion, as your character moves from one profession to another.
</p>
<p>
Characters use professional skills to improve their Wealth. You make a professional skill check to improve your Wealth score every time you attain a new level. The Difficulty is your current Wealth score. If you succeed, your Wealth score increases by +1. For every 5 points the check result exceeds the Difficulty, your Wealth score increases by an additional +1. You can't take 10 or 20 when making a professional skill check to improve your Wealth score.
</p>
<p>
Your rank in your current professional skill also automatically adds to the Wealth score increase you receive upon gaining a new level. See the accompanying table for details. (This bonus is accounted for in a character's starting Wealth score of +5.)
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th align="center"> Ranks  </th>
  <th align="center"> Wealth Score Increase </th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center"> 1-5  </td>
  <td align="center"> +1 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center"> 6-10  </td>
  <td align="center"> +2 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center"> 11-15  </td>
  <td align="center"> +3 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center"> 16-20  </td>
  <td align="center"> +4 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center"> 21-23  </td>
  <td align="center"> +5 </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Example: Lady Aris is a negotiator (and 3rd-level expert) with Wealth +13 and Diplomacy +6 (her professional skill). When she reaches 4th level, her Diplomacy increases to +7, and she makes a Diplomacy check to see if her Wealth improves from all her careful negotiation. The Difficulty is 13, her current Wealth score. On a result of 13 or more, her Wealth increases to +16 (+1 for succeeding on the check, +2 for having 7 ranks in her professional skill). For every 5 points the check exceeds 13 (at 18, 23, and so forth), her Wealth increases an additional +1.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Wealth Awards"></a>
<h4>Wealth Awards</h4>

<p>
Adventuring may result in characters finding valuable items or receiving financial rewards. In such cases, the benefit translates into a Wealth award determined by the Narrator. Generally, Wealth awards are limited to no more than a +4 increase to Wealth, and are usually less, around +1 or +2.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Selling Things"></a>
<h3>Selling Things</h3>

<p>
To sell something, determine its sale value. Assuming the item is undamaged and in working order, the sale value is equal to the item's purchase cost (as if bought new) minus 3.
</p>
<p>
Selling something can provide an increase to your Wealth score. The increase is the same amount as the Wealth score loss you would experience if you purchased an object with a cost equal to the sale value.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of your current Wealth score, your Wealth increases by 1 whenever you sell an object with a sale value of 15 or higher. If you sell something with a sale value less than or equal to your current Wealth score, and the sale value is 14 or lower, you gain nothing (the income from the sale is negligible).
</p>
<p>
Selling objects illegally usually requires contacts in the black market and reduces the sale value by an additional 3. This takes a number of hours equal to the normal cost of the item.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Weapons"></a>
<h2>Weapons</h2>

<p>
Weapons give heroes an edge in combat, and many heroes wield distinctive weapons. This section describes common weapons available to True SRD characters.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Weapon Categories"></a>
<h3>Weapon Categories</h3>

<p>
Weapons are grouped into several categories. These pertain to what training is needed to use the weapon, the weapon's usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), and its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed).
</p>
<p>
Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons: Heroes of all roles are considered trained with simple weapons. Warriors (and others with the Weapon Training feat) are trained with martial weapons as well. The Exotic Weapon Training feat is required for training in an exotic weapon. Anyone using a weapon untrained takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls.
</p>
<p>
Melee and Ranged Weapons: Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some of them can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.
</p>
<p>
Reach Weapons: Lances, longspears, and whips are reach weapons. A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike targets further away. Most double the wielder's natural reach, meaning a typical mediumsized wielder can attack an opponent 10 feet away, but not an adjacent opponent 5 or fewer feet away, inside the weapon's reach. A typical large character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size can attack an opponent 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet away.
</p>
<p>
Thrown Weapons: Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, tridents, and nets are thrown weapons. The wielder's Strength score applies to damage dealt by thrown weapons. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action.
</p>
<p>
Projectile Weapons: Light crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows, and composite longbows are projectile weapons. Most projectile weapons require two hands to use. A character gets no Strength bonus on damage with a projectile weapon, unless it's a specially built composite bow or a sling. If the character has a negative Strength score, apply it to damage when using a bow or a sling but not a crossbow.
</p>
<p>
Ammunition: Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows for bows, bolts for crossbows, and sling bullets for slings. When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading. Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while normal ammunition that misses has a 50 percent chance of being destroyed or lost.
</p>
<p>
Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons: This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat.
</p>
<p>
Light: A light weapon is easier to use in one's off hand than a one-handed weapon is, and it can be used while grappling. A light weapon is used in one hand. Add the wielder's Strength score to damage for melee attacks with a light weapon if it's used in the primary hand, or half the wielder's Strength score (if positive) if it's used in the off hand. An unarmed strike is considered a light weapon. 
</p>
<p>
One-Handed: A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand.
</p>
<p>
Two-Handed: Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively.
</p>
<p>
Improvised Weapons: Sometimes objects not intended as weapons see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses one in combat is considered untrained and takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals +3 damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet. Characters can take the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat in Improvised Weapons, removing the -4 attack roll penalty with them.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Weapon Qualities"></a>
<h3>Weapon Qualities</h3>

<p>
Here are the weapon qualities specified in the Weapons table.
</p>
<p>
Cost: This is the purchase Difficulty of the weapon. The cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon, such as sheaths or scabbards.
</p>
<p>
Damage: This is the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit. Melee and thrown weapons add the wielder's Strength to this damage.
</p>
<p>
Critical: The entry in this column notes how the weapon is used with the rules for critical hits. When your character scores a critical hit, increase the damage as indicated.
</p>
<p>
+3: The weapon deals +3 damage on a critical hit.
</p>
<p>
+4: The weapon deals +4 damage on a critical hit.
</p>
<p>
+5: The weapon deals +5 damage on a critical hit.
</p>
<p>
19-20/+3: The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals +3 damage on a critical hit.
</p>
<p>
18-20/+3: The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 18, 19, or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals +3 damage on a critical hit.
</p>
<p>
Range Increment: Any ranged attack at less than this distance is not penalized for range. However, each full range increment imposes a cumulative -2 penalty on the attack roll. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot out to ten range increments.
</p>
<p>
Weight: This column gives the weight of a version of the weapon for a medium-sized wielder. Halve this number for small weapons and double it for large weapons.
</p>
<p>
Type: Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. Some monsters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons.
</p>
<p>
Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon is of two types, the damage it deals is all of both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage from such a weapon.
</p>
<p>
In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation when the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Weapon Descriptions"></a>
<h3>Weapon Descriptions</h3>

<p>
Arrows: An arrow used as a melee weapon is a light improvised weapon (-4 penalty on attack rolls) that deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical +3). Arrows come in a quiver holding 20 arrows.
</p>
<p>
Bolas: You can use this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a set of bolas.
</p>
<p>
Bolts: A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (-4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical +3). Bolts come in a wooden case that holds 10 bolts.
</p>
<p>
Bullets, Sling: Bullets come in a leather pouch that holds 10 bullets.
</p>
<p>
Crossbow, Heavy: You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action. Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a -4 penalty on attack rolls.
</p>
<p>
Crossbow, Light: You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. Loading a light crossbow is a move action. Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one hand at a -2 penalty on attack rolls.
</p>
<p>
Dagger: You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a dagger on your body.
</p>
<p>
Flail or Heavy Flail: With a flail, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails). You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the flail to avoid being tripped.
</p>
<p>
Gauntlet: This metal glove lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes. A strike with a gauntlet is otherwise considered an unarmed attack. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. Medium and heavy suits of armor (except breastplates) come with gauntlets.
</p>
<p>
Gauntlet, Spiked: Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of spiked gauntlets. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet.
</p>
<p>
Javelin: Since it is not designed for melee, you are treated as untrained with it and take a -4 penalty on attack rolls if you use a javelin as a melee weapon.
</p>
<p>
Lance: A lance deals +3 additional damage when used from the back of a charging mount. It has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe. While mounted, you can wield a lance with one hand.
</p>
<p>
Longbow: You need at least two hands to use a bow. A longbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted. If you have a negative Strength score, apply it to damage when you use a longbow. If you have a positive Strength score, you can apply it to damage when you use a composite longbow but not a regular longbow.
</p>
<p>
Longbow, Composite: You need at least two hands to use a bow. You can use a composite longbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength score to use). If your Strength score is less than the strength rating of the bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite longbow requires a Strength of 0 or higher. A composite longbow can be made with a high Strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds +1 to its cost. For purposes of Weapon Focus and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.
</p>
<p>
Longspear: You can strike opponents 10 feet away with a longspear, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe. If you use a ready action to set a longspear against a charge, you deal +3 additional damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
</p>
<p>
Net: A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make an attack against your target. A net's maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target is entangled. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -2 penalty on Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding on an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits the rope allows. If the entangled creature attempts to use powers, it must make a Difficulty 15 Concentration check to succeed. An entangled creature can escape with a Difficulty 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net is Toughness 5 and can be burst with a Difficulty 25 Strength check (also a full-round action). A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of your own size.
</p>
<p>
You must fold a net to throw it effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, make a normal attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2 rounds for a trained user to fold a net and twice that long for an untrained one to do so.
</p>
<p>
Quarterstaff: A quarterstaff is a hardwood shaft, typically between 5 and 6 feet long. You can wield it one- or two-handed.
</p>
<p>
Sap: A sap is a bludgeoning weapon that inflicts non-lethal damage.
</p>
<p>
Scythe: A scythe can be used to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the scythe to avoid being tripped.
</p>
<p>
Shield, Heavy or Light: You can bash an opponent with a shield, using it as an off-hand weapon. See the Weapons table for the damage dealt by a shield bash. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a shield as a one-handed weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its Defense bonus until your next action (usually until the next round).
</p>
<p>
Shortbow: You need at least two hands to use a bow. You can use a shortbow while mounted. If you have a negative Strength score, apply it to damage when you use a shortbow. If you have a positive Strength score, you can apply it to damage when you use a composite shortbow but not a regular shortbow.
</p>
<p>
Shortbow, Composite: You need at least two hands to use a bow. You can use a composite shortbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular Strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength score to use). If your Strength score is less than the Strength rating of the bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite shortbow requires a Strength of 0 or higher. A composite shortbow can be made with a high Strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds +1 to its cost. For purposes of Weapon Focus and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow.
</p>
<p>
Shortspear: A shortspear is small enough to wield one-handed. It can also be thrown.
</p>
<p>
Sickle: A sickle can be used to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the sickle to avoid being tripped.
</p>
<p>
Sling: Your Strength score applies to damage when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action requiring two hands. You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals -1 damage, and you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls.
</p>
<p>
Spear: A spear can be thrown. If you use a ready action to set a spear against a charge, you deal +3 additional damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
</p>
<p>
Strike, Unarmed: A medium-sized character deals +0 non-lethal damage with an unarmed strike, plus the character's Strength score. Anyone with the Improved Strike feat can deal lethal or non-lethal damage with unarmed strikes.
</p>
<p>
Sword, Bastard: A bastard sword is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. You can use a bastard sword two-handed as a martial weapon.
</p>
<p>
Trident: This weapon can be thrown. If you use a ready action to set a trident against a charge, you deal +3 additional damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
</p>
<p>
Whip: A whip deals non-lethal damage. It deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).
</p>
<p>
You can make trip attacks with a whip. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the whip to avoid being tripped.
</p>
<p>
When using a whip, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed if the attack fails).
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Masterwork Weapons"></a>
<h3>Masterwork Weapons</h3>

<p>
A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding it provides a +1 bonus on attack rolls.
</p>
<p>
You can't add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork weapon. The masterwork quality increases the cost of a normal weapon by +5.
</p>
<p>
Masterwork ammunition is damaged (effectively destroyed) when used. The masterwork bonus of masterwork ammunition does not stack with any bonus of the weapon firing it.
</p>
<p>
Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you can't create a masterwork version of such an item conferring a bonus on attack rolls. Instead, masterwork armor and shields have lessened armor check penalties (see below).
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Armor"></a>
<h2>Armor</h2>

<p>
Many adventurers disdain excessive armor; they prefer mobility and speed to the bulk of armor. However, warriors in particular still wear armor, and its common on battlefields. Heroes expecting heavy combat may choose to wear armor for the additional protection it offers.
</p>
<p>
To wear armor effectively, a character needs the Armor Training feat (see <a href="Feats.html#Chapter 3: Feats - Armor Training (General)">Armor Training</a> in Chapter 3). Experts are automatically trained in light armor, while warriors are trained in all types of armor. Adepts aren't trained in wearing armor, but can acquire Armor Training.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Armor Qualities"></a>
<h3>Armor Qualities</h3>

<p>
Here are the armor qualities specified in the Armor and Shields table.
</p>
<p>
Cost: This is the armor's purchase Difficulty.
</p>
<p>
Bonus: Each armor or shield grants a bonus. Armor grants a bonus to Toughness saving throws. Shields grant a bonus to Defense by deflecting attacks. The bonus from a suit of armor doesn't stack with other armor. Similarly, the bonus from a shield doesn't stack with other shields.
</p>
<p>
Dodge: This is the maximum dodge bonus to Defense this type of armor allows. Heavier armors limit mobility, reducing the wearer's ability to dodge. This restriction doesn't affect other Dexterity-related abilities.
</p>
<p>
Even if your dodge bonus drops to 0 because of armor, this situation does not count as losing your dodge bonus to Defense; you still have it, it's just +0.
</p>
<p>
Except for tower shields, shields do not affect a character's maximum dodge bonus.
</p>
<p>
Penalty: Any armor heavier than leather limits your ability to use some physical skills. The armor check penalty applies to Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Jump, Sleight of Hand, Sneak, and Swim checks. Double the normal armor check penalty is applied to Swim checks. If you are wearing armor and using a shield, both armor check penalties apply.
</p>
<p>
Untrained Penalty: A hero untrained in wearing armor or using a shield applies the armor check penalty to attack rolls and all Strength- and Dexterity-based checks. The armor check penalty for armor stacks with the penalty for shields.
</p>
<p>
Sleeping in Armor: A character sleeping in medium or heavy armor is fatigued the next day (see <a href="PlayingTheGame.html#Chapter 6: Playing the Game - Fatigue">Fatigue</a> in Chapter 6). Sleeping in light armor does not cause fatigue.
</p>
<p>
Speed: Medium or heavy armor slows the wearer down. The number on the Armor and Shields table is the character's speed while wearing the armor. Shields do not affect a character's speed.
</p>
<p>
Weight: This column gives the weight of the armor sized for a Medium wearer. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and armor for large characters weighs twice as much.

<h3>Armor Descriptions</h3>

<p>
Any special benefits or accessories to the armor found on the Armor and Shields table are described here.
</p>
<p>
Banded Mail: The suit includes gauntlets.
</p>
<p>
Breastplate: It comes with a helmet and greaves.
</p>
<p>
Buckler: This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm. You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also use your shield arm to wield a weapon (whether you are using an off-hand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a two-handed weapon), but you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. This penalty stacks with those that may apply for fighting with your off hand and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a weapon in your off hand, you don't get the buckler's Defense bonus for the rest of the round. You can't bash someone with a buckler.
</p>
<p>
Chain Shirt: A chain shirt comes with a steel cap.
</p>
<p>
Chain Mail: The suit includes gauntlets.
</p>
<p>
Full Plate: The suit includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a smith. A captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner with a purchase Difficulty of 12.
</p>
<p>
Half-Plate: The suit includes gauntlets.
</p>
<p>
Hide: This suit includes gauntlets.
</p>
<p>
Scale Mail: The suit includes gauntlets.
</p>
<p>
Shield, Tower: This massive wooden shield is nearly as tall as you are. In most situations, it provides the indicated shield bonus to Defense; however, you can instead use it as total cover, though you must give up your attacks to do so. You cannot bash with a tower shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything else.
</p>
<p>
When employing a tower shield in combat, you take a -2 penalty on attack rolls because of the shield's encumbrance.
</p>
<p>
Splint Mail: The suit includes gauntlets.

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Masterwork Armor"></a>
<h3>Masterwork Armor</h3>

<p>
Just as with weapons, you can purchase or craft masterwork armor and shields. Such a well-made item functions like the normal version, except that its armor check penalty is 1 less than normal.
</p>
<p>
A masterwork suit of armor or shield increases the item's cost by +3.
</p>
<p>
The masterwork quality of a suit of armor or shield does not provide a bonus on attack or damage, even if the armor or shield is used as a weapon.
</p>
<p>
You can't add the masterwork quality to armor or a shield after it is created; it must be made as a masterwork item.

Caltrops: A caltrop is a four-pronged iron spike crafted so one prong faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground so your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2-pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.
</p>
<p>
Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it might step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll (attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the creature's shield and deflection bonuses do not count. If the target is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 bonus to Defense. If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one. The caltrop deals -1 damage, but a hurt creature's speed is reduced by one-half. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the injury is successfully treated with a Difficulty 15 Heal check, or until the injury received from the caltrop is healed. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.

</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Mounts and Related Gear"></a>
<h3>Mounts and Related Gear</h3>

<p>
Barding, Medium Creature and Large Creature: Barding is a type of armor covering the head, neck, chest, body, and possibly legs of a horse or other mount. Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed. Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on the Armor and Shields table.
</p>
<p>
Armor for a horse has a cost equal to regular armor +10 and weighs twice as much. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount wearing it, as shown on the table below.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th align="left"> Barding  </th>

</p>
<p>
Donkey or Mule: Donkeys and mules are stolid in the face of danger, hardy, surefooted, and capable of carrying heavy loads over vast distances. Unlike a horse, a donkey or a mule is willing (though not eager) to enter dungeons and other strange or threatening places.
</p>
<p>
Feed: Horses, donkeys, mules, and ponies can graze to sustain themselves, but providing feed for them is much better.
</p>
<p>
Horse: A horse is suitable as a mount for a Medium rider. Warhorses can be ridden easily into combat. Other horses are hard to control in combat.
</p>
<p>
Pony: A pony is suitable as a mount for a Small rider (generally only a child). They're more commonly used as beasts of burden in mountainous regions.

<p>
Saddle, Riding: The standard riding saddle supports a rider.

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Arcane Equipment"></a>
<h3>Arcane Equipment</h3>

<p>
In addition to the various mundane equipment characters can acquire there are various items endowed with arcane properties. Such equipment is rare and usually expensive, but sometimes found in the hand of heroes and villains. Creating arcane items requires the Imbue Item feat (see <a href="Feats.html#Chapter 3: Feats - Imbue Item (Arcane)">Imbue Item</a> in Chapter 3).
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Arcane Weapons"></a>
<h4>Arcane Weapons</h4>

<p>
A masterwork weapon can be imbued with arcane power, making it a arcane weapon. Arcane weapons have the usual properties of masterwork weapons, plus they can overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures. Since arcane trumps all other means of overcoming damage reduction, if a creature's damage reduction can be overcome at all, a arcane weapon will do so.
</p>
<p>
The arcane property increases a weapon's cost by +10. This includes the masterwork quality of the weapon.
</p>
<p>
Creating a arcane weapon requires the Imbue Item feat.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Arcane Armor"></a>
<h4>Arcane Armor</h4>

<p>
Masterwork armor can be imbued with arcane power, making it extraordinarily light and comfortable. Arcane armor has its armor check penalty reduced by 2 (including the benefits of being masterwork).
</p>
<p>
The arcane property increases the armor's cost by +6, which includes the masterwork quality.
</p>
<p>
Creating arcane armor requires the Imbue Item feat.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Arcane Elixirs"></a>
<h4>Arcane Elixirs</h4>

<p>
Characters with the Brew Elixir feat and the Craft (elixir) skill can create a variety of arcane elixirs from herbs, roots, and other natural materials. 
</p>

<h5>Enhancing</h5>

<p>
An enhancing elixir improves the drinker's arcana. For 10 minutes after the sweet-tasting elixir is consumed, the adept gains a bonus on all arcana checks (cumulative +1 per dose of enhancing elixir consumed). After the elixir wears off, the drinker suffers a level of fatigue per dose consumed. If the fatigue renders the character unconscious, any remaining fatigue levels become lethal damage levels. Anyone who takes more than five doses of enhancing elixir within a 24 hour period must also make a Fortitude saving throw (Difficulty 15). A failed save means the character's condition becomes dying. <i>Cost:</i> 18 per dose; <i>Difficulty to make:</i> 12 per dose.
</p>

<h5>Healing</h5>

<p>
This sweet-tasting elixir grants the drinker an immediate recovery check, in addition to the drinker's normal checks. Only one draught of healing elixir per day is effective; additional doses on the same day have no effects. <i>Cost:</i> 10 per dose; <i>Difficulty to make:</i> 12 per dose.
</p>

<h5>Recovery</h5>

<p>
This chalky-tasting elixir speeds the recovery of fatigue. One dose allows the drinker to recover at twice the normal rate (making recovery checks twice as often). A second dose in the same day improved recover rate by another 50 percent and a third dose has no effect until at least 24 hours have passed. <i>Cost:</i> 7 per dose; <i>Difficulty to make:</i> 20 per dose.
</p>

<h5>Stamina</h5>

<p>
For up to 8 hours after drinking this sour elixir, a character can accumulate fatigue from arcana with no ill effects. The fatigue is postponed until the elixir wears off. Then the drinker suffers all the fatigue at once. If the fatigue renders the character unconscious, additional fatigue levels become levels of lethal damage. If the damage level exceeds dying, the character dies immediately. <i>Cost:</i> 12 per dose; <i>Difficulty to make:</i> 25.
</p>

<h5>Stimulation</h5>

<p>
This effervescing formula unlocks latent arcane potential. The drinker gains ranks in a particular arcanum (chosen when the elixir is made). The ranks last for 10 minutes before fading. After the elixir wears off, the drinker suffers a level of fatigue. A second dose of stumation elixir within 24 hours has half its normal effect (round down), and a third dose has no effect. <i>Cost:</i> 17 + (ranks x 2); <i>Difficulty to make:</i> 10 + (ranks x 2).
</p>

<h5>Suppresion</h5>

<p>
This bitter-tasting formula suppresses arcane talents. It must be consumed (drunk or mixed with food). The victim makes a Fortitude saving throw (Difficulty 15). A failed save results in the inability to use arcana for 1 hour. Once a dose of suppression elixir has taken effect, the first dose must wear off before another can be applied. <i>Cost:</i> 15; <i>Difficulty to make:</i> 25.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 5: Equipment - Arcane Stones"></a>
<h4>Arcane Stones</h4>

<p>
Certain crystals and stones have the potential to hold and channel arcane energy in various ways. Adepts often set stones into jewelry, particularly diadems, rings, and necklaces, and use them to decorate wands and staves (which are otherwise mundane). Arcane stones must be prepared for use with the Imbue Stone feat.  A single stone may have multiple functions; each function is imbued separately. Arcane stones have negligible weight. 
</p>

<h5>Beacon</h5>

<p>
A beacon stone can attune itself to the psychic impressions of its owner (....)

<p>
This stone has a crude form of Second Sight, makign it sensitive to arcane energy. The stone glows softly whenever arcana are used nearby (....)
</p>
