<h1>CHAPTER 8: ADVERSARIES</h1>

<p>
Heroes in True SRD games fight all sorts of adversaries. Villains are often other characters (created using the same rules for creating heroes), but they may also be various sorts of monsters. This chapter provides some sample creatures you can use as adversaries in your True SRD adventures.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Minions"></a>
<h3>Minions</h3>

<p>
While heroes and important Narrator characters use the rules described previously, minor characters in the story are less capable (and durable). These characters and creatures are known as minions, and they follow special rules, particularly where damage is concerned.
</p>
<p>
A minion makes a Toughness save against damage normally; however, if the save fails, the minion suffers the maximum possible damage result for that attack. Usually this means unconsciousness for a non-lethal attack and death for a lethal attack. If the attacker wishes, the minion can suffer a lesser damage result. This means minions generally have only three damage conditions: normal, unconscious, and dead. This makes it easier for heroes to dispatch less important opponents and easier for the Narrator to keep track of them in combat.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, minions never have Conviction, even if they have levels in a heroic role. Their part in the story simply isn't important enough.
</p>
<p>
Note that the Narrator decides which characters and creatures are minions. In some cases, whether or not opponents count as minions may depend on the importance of the scene in the story. Not all followers are minions! For example, if the heroes are valiantly fighting their way past the undead guards of a sorcerer's citadel, then the Narrator may wish to consider those skeletons and zombies minions. On the other hand, when the heroes fight the sorcerer's ogre lieutenant, the Narrator chooses not to treat it as a minion, even though it is a follower of another Narrator character.

<h2>Creatures</h2>

<p>
Each creature in this chapter is given in the same general format, and includes the following information:
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Size"></a>
<h4>Size</h4>

<p>
While heroes come in all sizes and shapes, most are generally within the human norms of size, between four and eight feet tall or so (medium-sized).
</p>
<p>
Some creatures, however, vary in size, from as small as mice to as large as dinosaurs. A creature's size affects certain traits. Modifications for size are shown on the Size Table.

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Combat Modifier"></a>
<h4>Combat Modifier</h4>

<p>
Larger creatures are easier to notice and hit relative to smaller ones, while smaller creatures are harder to notice and hit. Apply the combat modifier for the creature's size to its attack rolls and Defense. These modifiers cancel out for creatures of the same size, who attack and defend normally against each other.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Grapple Modifier"></a>
<h4>Grapple Modifier</h4>

<p>
Larger creatures have an advantage in trying to grapple smaller opponents. In addition to the modifier to grapple checks, a larger creature can grapple more opponents of a smaller size: double the number of opponents the creature can grapple at once per size category the attacker is larger than the defenders. So a medium attacker can grapple one medium opponent, two small opponents (one under each arm, for example), four tiny opponents, and so forth.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Sneak Modifier"></a>
<h4>Sneak Modifier</h4>

<p>
Larger creatures have a harder time sneaking around, while smaller creatures have an easier time remaining unseen and unheard. Apply this modifier to Sneak checks made at this size.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Toughness Modifier"></a>
<h4>Toughness Modifier</h4>

<p>
Larger creatures are tougher than smaller creatures with the same Constitution. Apply the Toughness modifier for the creature's size category to its Toughness saving throws.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Reach"></a>
<h4>Reach</h4>

<p>
A normal (medium-sized) creature has a 5 ft. reach, which means the creature can make a melee attack at any target up to 5 ft. away. Larger and smaller creatures have a longer or shorter reach, as shown on the Size Table.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Space"></a>
<h4>Space</h4>

<p>
A normal (medium-sized) creature is assumed to occupy a roughly 5-ft.- by-5-ft. space. Larger and smaller creatures occupy more or less space, as shown on the Size Table.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Carrying Capacity"></a>
<h4>Carrying Capacity</h4>

<p>
Larger creatures can lift and carry more, while smaller creatures can lift and carry less. Larger creatures gain a doubling in carrying capacity per size category larger than medium. Smaller creatures' carrying capacities are multiplied by the value in this column. So a tiny creature with Str 10 has a heavy load of (100 x 1/2) or 50 lbs.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Speed"></a>
<h4>Speed</h4>

<p>
A creature's speed is the amount of distance it can cover in one move action. If a creature wears armor that reduces its speed, this is indicated along with a note specifying the armor type; the creature's base unarmored speed follows.
</p>
<p>
If the creature has other modes of movement, these are given after the main entry. Unless noted otherwise, such modes of movement are natural, not powers.
</p>
<p>
Burrow: The creature can tunnel through dirt but not through rock, unless the descriptive text says otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Climb: A creature with a climb speed has a +8 bonus on Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a Difficulty greater than 0, but it can always take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. The creature climbs at the given speed. If it attempts an accelerated climb, it moves at double the given climb speed (or its normal land speed, whichever is less) and makes a single Climb check at a -5 penalty. Creatures cannot move all out while climbing. The creature retains its dodge bonus (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on their attack rolls against a climbing creature.
</p>
<p>
Fly: The creature can fly at the given speed if carrying no more than a medium load. Flying creatures can make dive attacks. A dive attack works like a charge, but the diving creature must move a minimum of 30 feet. It can make only claw attacks, but these deal +3 damage. Creatures can move all out while flying, provided they fly in a straight line.
</p>
<p>
Swim: A creature with a swim speed can move through water at the given speed without making Swim checks. It gains a +8 bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. The creature can always take 10, even if distracted or endangered when swimming. Creatures can move all out while swimming, provided they swim in a straight line.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Abilities"></a>
<h4>Abilities</h4>

<p>
Creatures have the same ability scores as heroes: Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intelligence (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha), although some creatures lack certain ability scores. see <a href="HeroCreation.html#Chapter 1: Hero Creation - Nonexistent Abilities">Nonexistent Abilities</a> in Chapter 1 for more information.
</p>
<p>
Strength: Quadrupeds can carry heavier loads than bipedal creatures. Rather than using the carrying capacity multipliers in the <a href="Adversaries.html#Chapter 8: Adversaries - Table - Size">Size table</a> above, quadrupeds use the following multipliers: Colossal x24, Gargantuan x12, Huge x6, Large x3, Medium x1-1/2, Small x1, Tiny x3/4, Diminutive x1/2, and Fine x1/4.
</p>
<p>
Intelligence: A creature can speak all the languages mentioned in its descriptive text. Any creature with an Intelligence score of -3 or higher understands at least one language.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Skills"></a>
<h4>Skills</h4>

<p>
This section alphabetically lists the creature's skills along with skill modifiers, including adjustments for ability scores and any bonuses from feats or other traits.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Feats"></a>
<h4>Feats</h4>

<p>
This section alphabetically lists any feats the creature may have.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Traits"></a>
<h4>Traits</h4>

<p>
Creatures often have various special traits listed in their statistics and described here.
</p>
<p>
Blindsense: Using nonvisual senses, such as acute smell or hearing, a creature with blindsense notices things it cannot see. The creature usually does not need to make Notice checks to pinpoint the location of a creature within range of its blindsense ability, provided the creature does not have total cover. Any opponent the creature cannot see normally still has total concealment, and the creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its dodge bonus to Defense against attacks from creatures it cannot see.
</p>
<p>
Blindsight: Using nonvisual senses, such as sensitivity to vibrations, scent, acute hearing, or echolocation, the creature maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature. Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant to such a creature. The ability's range is specified in the text. The creature does not need to make Notice checks for creatures within range of its blindsight ability, it detects them automatically.
</p>
<p>
Constrict: The creature crushes the opponent, dealing bludgeoning damage, after making a successful grapple check. The amount of damage is given in the creature's entry. If the creature also has the improved grab ability, it deals constriction damage in addition to damage dealt by the attack used to grab.
</p>
<p>
Damage Reduction: The creature receives a bonus to its Toughness saving throws against certain attacks. The creature takes normal damage from energy attacks (acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic), powers, and supernatural special abilities.
</p>
<p>
The entry indicates the bonus and the type of attack that negates the ability. A supernatural weapon automatically negates any damage reduction negated by a mundane weapon type. For example, skeletons have damage reduction +2/bludgeoning. This means they get a +2 bonus to their Toughness saves, unless hit by a bludgeoning weapon. They would also lose their +2 bonus if hit by a supernatural weapon.
</p>
<p>
For purposes of harming other creatures with damage reduction, a creature's natural weapons count as the type that ignores its own damage reduction. For example, a vampire has damage reduction +4/silver and supernatural. This means a vampire can bypass the damage reduction of other creatures that are vulnerable to silver or supernatural weapons, including other vampires.
</p>
<p>
Darkvision: The creature can see in total darkness, out to the specified range (usually 60 feet). Darkvision is black-and-white only, but is otherwise like normal sight.
</p>
<p>
Disease: When heroes come into contact with a disease, they must make a Fortitude saving throw against a Difficulty of 10 + the disease's virulence rank to avoid becoming infected. The method of infection depends on the disease. Some are airborne, while others require physical contact.
</p>
<p>
If a hero becomes infected, there is a period of anywhere from a few hours to a week or more during which the disease lies dormant. Then the disease takes effect. The initial effect is typically a point or two of ability damage (usually Strength or Constitution or perhaps a point of each).
</p>
<p>
After that, the victim makes another Fortitude save against the same Difficulty each day to fight off the disease. If that save fails, the character suffers the disease's effects again. If it succeeds, there is no effect that day. Two successful Fortitude saves in a row indicate the character has fought off the disease. Some diseases may have additional effects, such as fatigue, nausea, or even rendering the hero disabled while fighting off the disease.
</p>
<p>
Fast Healing: The creature makes recovery checks at an exceptional rate, perhaps as often as once a minute (10 rounds). Fast healing stops working when a creature is dead. Except for its speed, fast healing works just like natural healing, and it doesn't provide any benefit against attacks that don't deal damage. It also doesn't allow a creature to regrow or reattach severed body parts.
</p>
<p>
Immunity: The creature is completely immune to some effect, suffering no harm or other effect from it. Essentially, the creature always succeeds on its saving throws against that effect, regardless of the Difficulty. So a creature immune to cold never suffers damage from cold.
</p>
<p>
Incorporeal: An incorporeal creature has no physical body. It can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, supernatural weapons or creatures that strike as supernatural weapons, and powers. It is immune to all mundane attack forms. Even when hit by supernatural or supernatural weapons, it has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source.
</p>
<p>
An incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus but has a bonus to its Defense equal to its Charisma score (always at least +1, even if the creature's Charisma score is +0 or less).
</p>
<p>
An incorporeal creature can pass through solid objects. An incorporeal creature's attacks likewise pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields. Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as they do in air. Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or take falling damage. Incorporeal creatures cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can they be tripped or grappled. In fact, they cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor are they subject to such actions. Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off traps triggered by weight.
</p>
<p>
An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard if it doesn't wish to be. It has no Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee attacks and its ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when they cannot see.
</p>
<p>
Night Vision: A creature with night vision can see twice as far as normal in poor lighting conditions. The creature can still distinguish colors, even in dim lighting.
</p>
<p>
Poison: Poison attacks deal initial damage, such as temporary ability damage or some other effect, to the victim on a failed Fortitude save. Unless otherwise noted, another saving throw is required 1 minute later (regardless of the first save's result) to avoid secondary damage. The Fortitude save against poison has a Difficulty equal to 10 + half the creature's level + the creature's Constitution score. A successful save negates the damage.
</p>
<p>
Powers: The creature can use various supernatural powers. Unless specified otherwise, a creature uses powers like an adept, with the normal effects and fatigue, if the power is fatiguing.
</p>
<p>
Resistance to Energy: The creature has a bonus to Toughness saving throws against damage of the given energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) each time the creature is subjected to such damage. The entry indicates the bonus and type of damage affected.
</p>
<p>
Scent: This ability allows the creature to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors, just as humans do familiar sights.
</p>
<p>
The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents can be detected at triple normal range.
</p>
<p>
When a creature detects a scent, the exact location is not revealed -- only its presence somewhere within range. The creature can take a move or standard action to note the direction of the scent. If it moves within 5 feet of the source, the creature can pinpoint that source.
</p>
A creature with the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom check to find or follow a track. The typical Difficulty for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This Difficulty increases or decreases depending on the strength of the quarry's odor, the number of creatures being tracked, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the Difficulty increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Combat"></a>
<h4>Combat</h4>

<p>
This section lists the creature's base attack, damage, Defense, and initiative bonuses, modified by the creature's other traits, as appropriate.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Saving Throws"></a>
<h4>Saving Throws</h4>

<p>
The creature's Toughness, Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saving throw are listed here. The modifiers take into account all of the creature's other traits.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Conviction"></a>
<h4>Conviction</h4>

<p>
Creatures generally have no Conviction points, but can gain Conviction by taking levels in a heroic role, in which case the creature acquires the same Conviction as a hero of that level. This is ignored if the Narrator has determined that a particular creature is a minion, since minions don't have Conviction (see <a href="Adversaries.html#Chapter 8: Adversaries - Minions">Minions</a> earlier in this chapter).
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Reputation"></a>
<h4>Reputation</h4>

<p>
A creature usually has a Reputation bonus of +0 but may increase the bonus by taking levels in a heroic role. The Narrator may decide certain creatures have a higher Reputation bonus, as suits the story.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 8: Adversaries - Ghost"></a>
<h4>Ghost</h4>

<p class="statblock">
Size: Medium <br>
Speed: fly 30 ft. <br>
Abilities: Str  -- , Dex +0, Con  -- , Int +0, Wis +1, Cha +3 <br>
Skills: Notice 8 (+9), Search 8 (+8), Sneak 8 (+8) <br>
Feats: Blind-Fight, Improved Initiative <br>
Traits: Darkvision, Manifestation, Rejuvenation, plus see below. <br>
Combat: Attack +3, Damage (by power), Defense +3, Initiative +4 <br>
Saving Throws: Toughness +5, Fortitude  -- , Reflex +1, Will +5
</p>
<p>
Ghosts are the undead spirits of intelligent beings who, for one reason or another, cannot move on from their living existence to their next life. A ghost greatly resembles its living form, but in some cases the spiritual form is somewhat altered.
</p>
<p>
Darkvision: Ghosts have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
</p>
<p>
Immunities: Ghosts are immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, and mind-influencing effects (including mind-influencing powers). They are not subject to critical hits, non-lethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, or any effect requiring a Fortitude save.
</p>
<p>
All ghosts have the manifestation ability plus one to three other traits described below. The save Difficulty against a ghost's traits is 12 + the ghost's Charisma score, unless otherwise noted.
</p>
<p>
Corrupting Touch: A ghost can use the Harm power with its incorporeal touch.
</p>
<p>
Drain Vitality: The ghost can use the Drain Vitality power with its incorporeal touch.
</p>
<p>
Frightful Moan: A ghost can emit a frightful moan like the fear effect of the Heart Shaping power. Doing so causes the ghost no fatigue.
</p>
<p>
Horrific Appearance: Any living creature within 60 feet that sees the ghost must succeed on a Fortitude save or immediately take 1 point of damage to all physical ability scores. A creature successfully saving against this effect is immune to the same ghost's horrific appearance for 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
Malevolence: Once per round, the ghost can merge its incorporeal form with a living creature by touch. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost's malevolence for 24 hours, and the ghost cannot enter the target's space. If the save fails, the ghost vanishes into the target's body and controls it like a use of the Dominate power.
</p>
<p>
Manifestation: Every ghost has this ability. A ghost dwells in the misty border realm between life and death and, as such, cannot affect or be affected by anything in the living world. When a ghost manifests, it partly enters the living world, becoming visible but incorporeal. When a ghost manifests, it can use any powers it possesses on material targets, provided they do not require physical contact. Only other incorporeal creatures, supernatural weapons, or powers can harm a manifested ghost. A manifested ghost can pass through solid objects at will. A manifested ghost always moves silently.
</p>
<p>
Move Object: A ghost can use the Move Object power as a standard action with a +15 bonus. Ghosts cannot expend fatigue on Move Object.
</p>
<p>
Rejuvenation: It's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat. The destroyed spirit restores itself within eight days. A ghost that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its old haunts with a successful level check (1d20 + ghost's Charisma) against Difficulty 16. As a rule, the only way to get rid of a ghost permanently is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from moving on. The exact means varies with each ghost and may require a good deal of research.

</p>
<p>
Vampires are among the most powerful and feared of the undead. They appear much as they did in life; although, their features are often hardened and feral, with the predatory look of wolves, and their skin is usually pale (except immediately after feeding).
</p>
<p>
Vampires often embrace finery and decadence and may assume the guise of nobility (if they were not already in life). Despite their appearance, vampires can be recognized by the fact that they cast no shadows and no reflections in mirrors.
</p>
<p>
Vampires have the following traits. Saves have a Difficulty of 14 + the vampire's Charisma score, unless noted otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Alternate Form: A vampire can assume the shape of a bat or wolf as a standard action. The vampire gains the natural weapons and attacks of its new form. It can remain in that form until it assumes another or until the next sunrise.
</p>
<p>
Blood Drain: A vampire can suck blood from a living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, draining 1 point of Constitution each round the pin is maintained. On each such successful attack, the vampire gains a recovery check with a bonus equal to the Constitution drained.
</p>
<p>
Children of the Night: Vampires command the lesser creatures of the world and once per day can call forth swarms of rats or bats or a pack of wolves as a standard action. These creatures arrive in within a minute and serve the vampire for up to an hour.
</p>
<p>
Create Spawn: If a vampire kills a victim with blood drain, the victim returns as a vampire in three days. The new vampire is under the command of the vampire that created it and remains enslaved until its master's destruction. At any given time, a vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own level; any spawn exceeding this limit are created as free-willed vampires. An enslaved vampire may create and enslave spawn of its own, so a master vampire can control a large number of lesser vampires in this fashion. A vampire may voluntarily free enslaved spawn in order to enslave new spawn, but once freed, a vampire cannot be enslaved again.
</p>
<p>
Damage Reduction: A vampire has damage reduction +4/silver and supernatural. A vampire's natural weapons are supernatural for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
</p>
<p>
Dominate: A vampire can dominate a victim like a use of the power of the same name. The ability has a range of 30 feet.
</p>
<p>
Fast Healing: A vampire makes a recovery check from damage each round. If dying, a vampire automatically assumes gaseous form and flees. It must reach its coffin within two hours or be destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in two hours.) Any additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest in its coffin, a vampire is helpless. It becomes disabled after an hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of one recovery check per round.
</p>
<p>
Gaseous Form: As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form. It has a fly speed of 20 feet and is immune to physical harm, but unable to make attacks or use any of its other traits.
</p>
<p>
Immunities: Vampires are immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, and mind-influencing effects (including mind-influencing powers). They are not subject to critical hits, non-lethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, or any effect requiring a Fortitude save, unless it works on inanimate objects.
</p>
<p>
Spider Climb: At a speed of 20 ft., a vampire can climb sheer surfaces with no Climb check and no chance of falling.
</p>
<p>
Weaknesses: For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses.
</p>
<p>
Repelling a Vampire: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm vampires merely keep them at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against a creature holding the item. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action each round.
</p>
<p>
Vampires are unable to cross running water, but can be carried over it while resting in their coffins or aboard a ship.
</p>
<p>
They are unable to enter a home or other building unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. They may freely enter public places, since these are by definition open to all.
</p>
<p>
Slaying a Vampire: Reducing a vampire's condition to disabled incapacitates it but doesn't destroy it (see the note on fast healing).
</p>
<p>
However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight disorients it; it can take only a single move or standard action and is destroyed utterly the following round if it cannot escape.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water causes it one level of lethal damage each round until its condition is disabled, then it is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a vampire's heart instantly disables it. However, it can recover if the stake is removed. A popular tactic is to cut off the staked vampire's head and fill its mouth with garlic, or to burn the body or expose it to sunlight, any of which will destroy it.

<p>
Zombies are corpses animated by sorcery. Because of their utter lack of intelligence, the instructions given to a newly created zombie must be simple and specific. Zombies do nothing except what they are commanded to do.
</p>
<p>
Immunities: Zombies are immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, and mind-influencing effects (including mind-influencing powers). They are not subject to critical hits, non-lethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, or any effect requiring a Fortitude save, unless it works on inanimate objects.
</p>
<p>
Slow: Zombies have poor reflexes and can perform only a single move action or standard action each round. A zombie can move up to its speed and attack in the same round, but only if it charges.
