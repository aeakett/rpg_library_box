<h1>CHAPTER 3: FEATS</h1>

<p>
While abilities, roles, and skills define a great deal about heroes, what really makes them heroes are feats, special abilities allowing your hero to do things most other people can't. Feats often allow heroes to "break the rules" in certain ways or provide them access to certain gifts or talents. Feats allow you to customize your hero's capabilities, focusing on the sorts of things you want.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Acquiring Feats"></a>
<h2>Acquiring Feats</h2>

<p>
Heroes start out with a certain number of feats, based on their role. They acquire a new feat each time they gain a level (either in that role or in a new role). Each role has access to the general feats, as well as its own list of feats. Players choose new feats for their heroes from these lists.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Types of Feats"></a>
<h3>Types of Feats</h3>

<p>
Some feats are general, meaning no special rules govern them as a group and they are available to everyone. Other feats are restricted to heroes of particular roles and related to performing those roles. Expert feats are limited to experts, martial feats are limited to warriors, and arcane feats are limited to adepts. A feat's type is listed after its name in the feat's description.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Prerequisites"></a>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>
Some feats have prerequisites. Your hero must have the indicated ability score, feat, skill, combat bonus, or other requisite trait(s) in order to acquire or use that feat. A hero can gain a feat and its prerequisites at the same level. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisites for any reason, you also lose the ability to use that feat.

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Feat Descriptions"></a>
<h2>Feat Descriptions</h2>

<p>
Each description lists the feat's name and its type, followed by any prerequisites. The description goes on to specify the feat's effects.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Accurate Attack (General)"></a>
<h4>Accurate Attack (General)</h4>

<p>
You can lessen your attack's damage to make a wider, more sweeping attack with a better chance to hit. Subtract a number up to 5 to your attack's damage bonus and add the same number to your attack roll. You cannot lower your damage bonus below 0 nor more than double your attack bonus.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Acrobatic Bluff (Expert)"></a>
<h4>Acrobatic Bluff (Expert)</h4>

<p>
You can use your Acrobatics skill instead of your Bluff skill to feint and trick in combat (see <a href="PlayingTheGame.html#Chapter 6: Playing the Game - Feint (Standard Action)">Feint</a>). Your opponent opposes the attempt with Sense Motive or Acrobatics (whichever is better).
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - All-out Attack (General)"></a>
<h4>All-out Attack (General)</h4>

<p>
With an all-out attack, you ignore defense in favor of accuracy. Subtract a number up to 5 from your dodge bonus and add the same number to your attack roll. You cannot lower your dodge bonus below 0 nor more than double your attack bonus. The changes to attack and defense bonus are declared before you make the attack roll and last until your next action.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Animism Talent (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Animism Talent (Arcane)</h4>

<p>
You can learn Animism arcana. You can also use the Beast Reading, Psychic Shield, and Second Sight arcana untrained. See <a href="Arcana.html#Chapter 4: Arcana">Chapter 4: Arcana</a> for details.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Arcane Balance (General)"></a>
<h4>Arcane Balance (General)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Improved Balance</i></p>
<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Body Control of rank 6 or higher.</i></p>
<p>
By exerting mental control over your body, you can walk across any surface, including water, quicksand, snow, and so forth, without sinking. Arcane Balance requires total concentration (a standard action each round) and lasta only as long as you concentrate. It requires a full-round actin to achieve the proper mentl state to use Arcane Balance (so you cannot usually use it to react to something like suddenly falling into water, for example). 
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Arcane Focus (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Arcane Focus (Arcane)</h4>

<p>
Choose an arcanum in which you are trained. You gain a +3 bonus on checks with the chosen power, or increase its effect by 3 ranks (if it does not require checks). You can take this feat more than once. Each time, it applies to a different power.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Arcane Speed (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Arcane Speed (Arcane)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Body Control rank 6 or higher.</i></p>
<p>
You can move at great speed in short bursts. When you use this feat, your movement speed increases to ten times normal for 1 round (6 seconds). This is considered running movement (a full-round action), and it is fatiguing (Difficulty 12). Arcane speed also multiplies your jumping distances by five.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Arcane Strike (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Arcane Strike (Arcane)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisites: Improved Strike.</i></p>
<p>
Your unarmed attacks are considered arcane weapons for overcoming the defenses of creatures vulnerable to such weapons.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Arcane Training (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Arcane Training (Arcane)</h4>

<p>
You're trained in certain arcana.  Each time you acquire this feat, choose two arcana belonging to the talents you have. You can now use those arcana. The two arcana do not have to belong to the same talent.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Arcane Weapon (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Arcane Weapon (Arcane)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisites: Combat +3 or higher.</i></p>
<p>
You can imbue a melee weapon you wield with arcane power. The weapon is considered a arcane weapon for overcoming the defenses of creatures vulnerable to such weapons. You must personally wield the weapon for it to gain this benefit.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Arcanum (General)"></a>
<h4>Arcanum (General)</h4>

<p>
You can use a particular arcanum without the need for the corresponding Arcane Talent feat or Arcane Training. You select the arcanum when you acquire this feat. Note that since Arcanum is a general feat, any character can acquire it (as opposed to the arcane talent feats, which are arcane feats and therefore available only to adepts).
</p>
<p>
When using your arcanum, your adept level in the arcanum is equal to your total level, even if you have no adept levels. Your arcanum fulfills prerequisites requiring a certain rank of training in the arcanum, but not prerequisites involving a particular arcane talent. You do not gain the benefits of the arcanum's underlying talent, including untrained use of certain arcana.
</p>
<p>
You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, it grants a new arcanum. See <a href="Arcana.html#Chapter 4: Arcana">Chapter 4: Arcana</a> for details on arcana and how they work. 
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Armor Training (General)"></a>
<h4>Armor Training (General)</h4>

<p>
You're trained in the proper way to move and fight while wearing armor. There are two versions of this feat: light and heavy. Each is considered a separate feat, and you must be trained in wearing light armor, for example, before you can acquire training in heavy armor. Characters without Armor Training apply their armor's check penalty (see <a href="Equipment.html#Chapter 5: Equipment - Armor">Armor</a> in Chapter 5) to all their physical rolls and checks, including attack rolls, while wearing it. Characters with Armor Training only apply the armor's check penalty to Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Jump, Sleight of Hand, Sneak, and Swim checks.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Assessment (General)"></a>
<h4>Assessment (General)</h4>

<p>
You're able to size up someone's combat capabilities. As a move action, choose a subject and make a Sense Motive check opposed by the subject's Bluff check result. If you succeed, the Narrator tells you the subject's combat bonus relative to yours (lower, higher, or equal). You don't know the subject's exact bonus unless it equals your own, only a rough estimate of relative ability. In cases of a 5-point or greater difference, the Narrator may choose to tell you the subject's bonus is considerably more or less than yours. If you lose the opposed roll, the Narrator should over- or under-estimate the subject's bonus.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Beloved (General)"></a>
<h4>Beloved (General)</h4>

<p>
You are one of the fortunate few to have found true love. Work with the Narrator to define who this person is. Your beloved may be another hero or a supporting character controlled by the Narrator. In either case, you should properly roleplay your hero's feelings.
</p>
<p>
You have a +4 on saving throws and check against effects that would sway you against your beloved in any way. Whenever you spend a Conviction poitn to reroll a die roll directly concerning your beloved, the roll is treated as a 20 (but not a natural 20). The Narrator decides when this is appropriate. Efforts to find a kidnapped or lost beloved, fighting your way to your beloved's side, or defending your beloved from a threat are all appropriate. 
</p>

<p>
Your familiar is an enhanced version of a normal animal, referred to as the base animal. The Familiar table indicates how the base animal is enhanced.
</p>
<p>
Level: This is your adept level. Enhancements to the familiar's traits are based on this. A familiar's combat bonus is the same as an expert of your adept level, and a familiar has good Fortitude and Reflex saves like an expert of your adept level.
</p>
<p>
Abilities: This is a bonus to the base animal's Strength, Dexterity, and
Intelligence scores.
</p>
<p>
Bonus Tricks: The number in this column is the total number of tricks the familiar knows, in addition to any you might choose to teach it using the Handle Animal skill. These bonus tricks don't require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don't count against the normal limit of tricks known by the animal. You select these bonus tricks, and once chosen, they can't be changed.
</p>
<p>
Link: You have a psychic link with your familiar. The two of you are always in mental contact (like a use of the Mind Touch power). If some outside force, such as the Ward power, interferes, you can make a Mind Touch or Wisdom check to overcome it. If your psychic link is broken, it is automatically reestablished as soon as possible. Because of your link, you can handle your familiar as a free action and push it as a move action, even if you aren't trained in the Handle Animal skill. You get a +4 bonus on interaction checks involving your familiar.
</p>
<p>
Share Arcana: You can choose to have any power you use on yourself also affect your familiar. This includes arcana like Body Control and Psychic Shield, which normally only affect the user. The familiar must be within 5 feet of you when the power is used to receive its effects. If the power has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the familiar when the familiar moves farther than 5 feet away from you and does not affect it again, even if it returns while the power is still in effect.
</p>
<p>
Evasion: If a familiar is subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.
</p>
<p>
Devotion: A familiar gains a +4 bonus on Will saves against any effect influencing its mind or emotions.
</p>
<p>
Speak: Your familiar can speak verbally with you as if you shared a common language. Others cannot understand your communication without the use of arcana.
</p>
<p>
Improved Evasion: When subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw fails.

<p>
One of your interaction skills is so effective you can capture and hold someone's attention with it. Choose Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Perform. Use a standard action and make a check using the interaction skill against your target's Sense Motive check or Will saving throw result (whichever has the higher bonus). If you succeed, the target pays no attention to anyone other than you. You may maintain the effect by taking a standard action each round, for a number of rounds equal to your skill rank. Any potential threat, such as an ally sneaking up on a fascinated target, grants a new Sense Motive check or Will save. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, automatically breaks the fascination. The fascination ends when you stop maintaining it or the target overcomes it. You may take this feat more than once. Each time, it applies to a different interaction skill.

You may take this feat multiple times, either choosing a different favored opponent or increasing your existing bonus by +2, to a maximum of +6.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Favors (General)"></a>
<h4>Favors (General)</h4>

<p>
You know people who can help you out from time to time. You can call in favors from people you know by making a Diplomacy check. It might be advice, information, help with a legal matter, or access to resources. The Narrator sets the Difficulty of the Diplomacy check, based on the aid required. A simple favor is Difficulty 10, ranging up to Difficulty 25 for especially difficult, dangerous, or expensive favors. You can spend a Conviction point to automatically secure the favor. The Narrator has the right to veto any request if it is too involved or likely to spoil the story. Use of this feat requires the time and means to contact your allies and call in the favor.

<h4>Imbue Life (Arcane)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Healing Talent</i></p>
<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Cure of rank 12 or higher.</i></p>
<p>
You can use the Cure arcanum to restore the dead to life! The subject cannot have been dead longer than your adept level in minutes, and you must make a Diffiulcty 25 Cure check, taking a minute of intense concentration.

</p>

<h4>Imbue Stone (Arcane)</h4>

<p>

</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Imbue Unlife (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Imbue Unlife (Arcane)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Healing Talent</i></p>
<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Flesh Shaping of rank 6 or higher.</i></p>
<p>
This perversion of the healing gift is considered among the foulest of sorcery. The adept channel arcane power to lend unlife to the dead, creating a mockery of life. Imbue Unlife may create two kinds of undead: mindless or intelligent.
</p>
<p>
Mindless: You turn the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies, which obey your spoken commands (see <a href="Adversaries.html#Chapter 8: Adversaries - Skeleton">Skeleton</a> and <a href="Adversaries.html#Chapter 8: Adversaries - Zombie">Zombie</a> in Chapter 8). They remain animated until destroyed. (A destroyed undead creature can't be imbued with unlife again.) Creating an unliving creature requires a minute of total concentration. 
</p>
<p>
A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls from its bones when it is created. A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of the type you create, you can't make more levels of unliving than twice your adept level with a single use of Imbue Unlife.
</p>
<p>
The skeletons or zombies you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this arcanum, however, you can control only four times your adept level in mindless undead. If you exceed this, all newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess from previous castings become uncontrolled. (You choose which creatures are released from your control.)
</p>
<p>
Intelligent: You transform a corpse into an intelligent undead creature. Unlike the mindless undead, this creature is not under your control; although, you can use other means, including other arcana, to command it. You can create a ghost, shadow, spectre, orvampire using this feat (see <a href="Adversaries.html#Chapter 8: Adversaries - Ghost">Ghost</a> and <a href="Adversaries.html#Chapter 8: Adversaries - Vampire">Vampire</a> in Chapter 8).
</p>
<p>
Imbue Unlife is a fatiguing task, with a fatigue save Difficulty of 10 + the unliving creature's level. Subtract the subject's Corruption score from the fatigue save Difficulty, since turning a corrupt creature into one of th unliving is easier than corrupting a once pure body and spirit. Imbue Unlife is sorcery, so using it calls for a Corruption check.
</p>

<h4>Imbue Weapon (Arcane)</h4>

You can make masterwork weapons into arcane weapons (see <a href="Equipment.html#Chapter 5: Equipment - Arcane Weapons">Arcane Weapons</a> in Chapter 5). Imbuing a weapon takes a week of meditation and ritual.

You can make finesse attacks with ranged weapons (see <a href="PlayingTheGame.html#Chapter 6: Playing the Game - Finesse Attack">Finesse Attack</a> in Chapter 6).
</p>

</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Improved Strike (General)"></a>
<h4>Improved Strike (General)</h4>

<p>
You can inflict lethal damage with your unarmed strikes. Normally unarmed attacks only inflict non-lethal damage. Your unarmed attacks are also more effective than normal. Increase your unarmed striking (but not grappling) damage by +1 for every four total levels, rounding up (+1 at levels 1-4, +2 at levels 5-8, and so forth).
</p>

<p>
You have a +2 bonus on Strength and Dexterity checks to trip an opponent, and they do not get an opportunity to trip you if you fail. see <a href="PlayingTheGame.html#Chapter 6: Playing the Game - Trip (Standard Action)">Trip</a> in Chapter 6 for details.

</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Inspire (Expert)"></a>
<h4>Inspire (Expert)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Charisma +1 or higher.</i></p>
<p>
You can inspire others with your presence. You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, you acquire a new type of inspiration. Using any Inspire effect requires a standard action and is considered a use of an interaction skill, even though no skill check is required. This means your subjects have to be able to hear and understand you.
</p>
<p>
You can affect a number of subjects equal to half your expert level (minimum of one), and the effects last for a number of rounds equal to your expert level. Unwilling targets make a Will saving throw (Difficulty 10 + half your level + your Charisma). You can use any combination of Inspire effects a total of once per day per two expert levels (so a 6th-level expert can Inspire three times a day).
</p>
<p>
Each time you take this feat, choose one of the following effects:
</p>
<p>
Awe: The subjects are overcome with your presence. They are dazed (taking no action, but defending normally) for one round. On each of the following rounds, subjects can make a Will save (with a cumulative +1 bonus for each save) to shake off their awe and act normally. 
</p>
<p>
Competence: Subjects are better able to focus on the task at hand, gaining a +2 bonus on all skill checks.
</p>
<p>
Complacency: The subjects let down their guard. They suffer a -5 penalty on Notice and Sense Motive checks. This also counts as a distraction sufficient to hide using Sneak.
</p>
<p>
Courage: The subjects overcome fear and doubt. They gain a +1 bonus on saves against fear and doubt and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage. This bonus increases to +2 when you are 8th level, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th.
</p>
<p>
Fear: Subjects are overcome with fear and anxiety. They are shaken and suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls, checks, and saving throws (except Toughness saves). If the save fails by 5 or more, they are panicked and flee from you as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>
Fury: Subjects gain the benefits of the Rage feat (see <a href="Feats.html#Chapter 3: Feats - Rage (Martial)">Rage feat</a> in Chapter 3) but also the normal fatigue when the rage wears off.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Iron Will (General)"></a>

</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Master Plan (Expert)"></a>
<h4>Master Plan (Expert)</h4>

<p>
If you have the opportunity to prepare for an encounter, you can formulate a plan to deal with it. This requires at least a few minutes, longer at the Narrator's discretion. Make an Intelligence check (Difficulty 10). If successful, you and your allies gain a bonus on all skill checks and attack rolls in the scene depending on the result of your check: +1 for a roll of 10-14, +2 for 15-24, and +3 for 25 or higher. You choose when during the scene to initiate your master plan. The bonus lasts for 3 rounds, then begins decreasing at a rate of 1 per round until it is gone. You can only use this feat when you have the opportunity to prepare for an encounter in advance, not when dealing with sudden or unexpected encounters.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Meditative Talent (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Meditative Talent (Arcane)</h4>

<p>

</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Mounted Archery (Martial)"></a>
<h4>Mounted Archery (Martial)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Mounted Combat.</i></p>
<p>
The penalty you take when using a ranged weapon while mounted is halved: -2 instead of -4 if your mount is taking a double move, and -4 instead of -8 if your mount is running.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Mounted Combat (General)"></a>
<h4>Mounted Combat (General)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Trained in Ride.</i></p>
<p>
Once per round when your mount is hit in combat, you may attempt a Ride check (as a reaction) to negate the hit. The hit is negated if your Ride check result is greater than the opponent's attack roll. (Essentially, the Ride check result becomes the mount's Defense if it's higher than the mount's regular Defense.)
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Night Vision (General)"></a>
<h4>Night Vision (General)</h4>

<p>
You can see twice as far in low-light conditions as a normal human. Your vision is still hindered normally by total darkness.

When you make an attack, you can take a penalty of up to -5 on your attack bonus and add the same number (up to +5) to your attack's damage bonus. Your attack bonus cannot be reduced below +0. The changes to attack and damage bonuses are decided before you make you attack roll and last until your next action.
</p>

<h4>Precise Shot (General)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Point Blank Shot.</i></p>

<h4>Psychic Shield Penetration (Arcane)</h4>

<p>
You're proficient at overcoming the resistance of Psychic Shields. You get a +2 bonus on checks to overcome a target's Psychic Shield.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Psychic Talent (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Psychic Talent (Arcane)</h4>

<p>
You can learn psychic arcana. You can also use the Mind Touch, Psychic Shield, and Second Sight arcana untrained. See <a href="Arcana.html#Chapter 4: Arcana">Chapter 4: Arcana</a> for details.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Psychic Weapon (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Psychic Weapon (Arcane)</h4>

<p>
You can create a melee weapon out of psychic energy. Take a move action to create the psychic weapon in your hand. The appearance of the weapon is up to you; its effects are the same regardless. You wield a psychic weapon like a normal melee weapon, except you are automatically considered trained with it.
</p>
<p>
You wield a psychic weapon like a normal melee weapon, except you are automatically considered trained in it, and you wield it as if you had the Weapon Finesse feat (meaning you apply your Dexterity rather than your Strength modifier to attack rolls).
</p>
<p>
The psychic weapon inflicts damage equal to half your level, rounded up. Add your Wisdom modifier rather than your Strength modifier to the weapon's damage bonus. You can score a critical hit with your Psychic Weapon on a natural roll of 20, inflicting +3 damage.
</p>
<p>
A psychic weapon is immaterial and only affects creatures with an Intelligence score. It has no effect on non-intelligent creatures or objects, meaning it cannot sunder or even block a material weapon. Two psychic weapons affect each other normally. If your psychic weapon is somehow knocked from your grasp or sundered by another psychic weapon, you can recreate it by taking a move action and making another arcanum check.
</p>
<p>
Creating a psychic weapon requires a fatigue save with a Difficulty of 10 + the weapon's damage bonus. The weapon lasts for one minute (10 rounds) after you summon it. To maintain it for another minute, make another fatigue save. Your psychic weapon disappears if you are stunned or unconscious.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Pure-Hearted (General)"></a>
<h4>Pure-Hearted (General)</h4>

<p>
You are difficult to corrupt. You get a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist any attempt to corrupt, bribe, or otherwise turn you from the right and proper path. This includes Corruption checks (see <a href="Arcana.html#Chapter 4: Arcana - Corruption">Corruption</a> in Chapter 4). You do not get this bonus if you voluntarily indulge in corrupt activities without a very good reason. You might be able to use sorcery, for example, for a very good cause, and stave off its corruption, but the Narrator should feel free to tempt you with opportunities to stray off the straight and narrow. Also, if your Shadow nature becomes dominant (see <a href="HeroCreation.html#Chapter 1: Hero Creation - Alignment and Natures">Alignment and Natures</a> in Chapter 1), you lose the benefits of this feat during that time.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Purifying Light (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Purifying Light (Arcane)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Light or Twilight alignment</i></p>
<p>
You can wield light as a weapon against Shadow. This feat allows you to do two things.
</p>
<p>
First, you can cast an arcane bolt of light as a ranged touch attack. This attack does lethal damage up to half your character level (rounded up) to aberrations, darkfiends, shadowspawn, and the unliving.  It does no damage to any other sort of creature.
</p>
<p>
Second, you can call forth a shining light to fill an area up to 60 feet across. Maintaining the area of pure light requires concentration. Any evil supernatural creature must make a Will save (Difficulty 10 + half your level + your Charisma score) in order to enter the area of light, and another Will save each round to remain there. A failed save means the creature cannot enter the area and must leave immediately if it is already inside it.
</p>
<p>
Both uses of Purifying Light are fatiguing, requiring a Will save (DC 10 + half your level) to avoid becoming fatigued. You make the fatigue save after each bolt of light and after you stop maintaining an area of light.
</p>
<p>
Special: If you ever change alignment to Shadow, or if you have a Corruption score, you lose the ability to use Purifying Light until your alignment changes back and you shed any Corruption.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Quick Draw (General)"></a>
<h4>Quick Draw (General)</h4>

<p>
You can draw or load a weapon as a free action, rather than a move action. You can only do one of these things as a free action each round; the other remains a move action as normal. So you could draw a weapon as a free action, then load it as a move action, for example, but not draw and load it as a free action. Taking this feat a second time allows you to both draw and load a weapon in the same round as free actions.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Quicken Arcana (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Quicken Arcana (Arcane)</h4>

<p>
Once per round, you can use an arcanum that normally requires a full-round action as a standard action, or an arcanum that normally requires a standard action as a move action. You can't use arcana more quickly than a move action using this feat. The fatigue Difficulty of the quickened power increases by +8.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Rage (Martial)"></a>
<h4>Rage (Martial)</h4>

<p>
You can fly into a berserk rage as a free action, gaining +2 Strength, +2 to your Fortitude and Will saves, and a -2 penalty to Defense. While raging you can't use skills or arcana requiring concentration or patience, and you can't take 10 or take 20 on checks. Your rage lasts five rounds, after which you are fatigued for five rounds (see <a href="PlayingTheGame.html#Chapter 6: Playing the Game - Fatigue">Fatigue</a> in Chapter 6). You can use Rage once per day at 1st level and an additional time per day for every four warrior levels (twice at 4th level, three times at 8th level, and so on).
</p>
<p>
Each additional time you take this feat you gain an additional +1 Strength and +1 Fortitude and Will save bonus to a maximum of +4 Strength and +4 to saves total (the -2 penalty to Defense and other effects remain the same).
</p>
<p>
Instead of increasing your Rage benefits, taking the Rage feat an additional time can extend the duration of your rage by 5 rounds. This also extends the duration of your post-rage fatigue by 5 rounds.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Ranged Pin (General)"></a>
<h4>Ranged Pin (General)</h4>

<p>
You can pin an opponent using a ranged weapon to nail a bit of clothing to a nearby surface. The target must be within 5 feet of a wall, tree, or similar surface. Make a normal attack roll against the target. If your attack is successful, the target is pinned. To break free, the victim must take a move action and make a successful Strength or Escape Artist check (Difficulty 15).
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Rhy-bonded (General)"></a>
<h4>Rhy-bonded (General)</h4>

<p>
You are psychically bonded to an intelligent companion.  You have a psychic link with your companion. The two of you are always in mental contact (like a use of the Mind Touch arcana). If some outside force, such as the Ward arcanum, interferes, you can make a Mind Touch or Wisdom check to overcome it. If your psychic link is broken, it is automatically reestablished as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
If your companion is a hero character under the control of another player, both characters must take this feat. 
</p>
<p>
If your companion is a Narrator character, he or she has a total level two levels lower than your own (with a minimum of 1st level). Your companion gains levels as you do but is always at least two levels lower than you. 
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Ride-By Attack (Martial)"></a>
<h4>Ride-By Attack (Martial)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Mounted Combat.</i></p>
<p>
When you are mounted, you can move both before and after you take a standard action, provided your total distance isn't greater than your mount's movement speed.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Run (General)"></a>
<h4>Run (General)</h4>

<p>
When running, you move five times your normal speed (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or four times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load). If you make a jump after a running start, you get a +4 bonus to your Jump check.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Second Chance (General)"></a>
<h4>Second Chance (General)</h4>

<p>
Choose a particular hazard, such as falling, being tripped, triggering traps, being mentally controlled (or affected by another specific power), or a particular skill with consequences for failure. If you fail a saving throw against that hazard or a check with that skill, you can immediately make another roll and use the better of the two results. Unlike spending a Conviction point, you do not treat rolls below 10 as a result of 10. You only get one second chance against any given save or task, and the Narrator decides if a particular hazard or skill is an appropriate focus for this feat. You can acquire this feat multiple times. Each time it applies to a different hazard or skill.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Seize Initiative (Martial)"></a>
<h4>Seize Initiative (Martial)</h4>

<p>
You can spend a Conviction point to go first in the initiative order, without having to roll for initiative. You may only do so when you would normally roll initiative. If more than one character uses this feat, they roll for initiative normally and act in order of their initiative result, followed by all the other characters involved in the combat.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Self-Healing (General)"></a>
<h4>Self-Healing (General)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Trained in Body Control.</i></p>
<p>
You can use Body Control like the Cure arcanum but only to affect yourself. You're subject to the normal limitations of using Cure on yourself, and you can acquire other feats with Cure as a prerequisite, but they also only work on yourself.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Sensitive (General)"></a>
<h4>Sensitive (General)</h4>

<p>
You're particularly sensitive to the emotions and attitudes of other creatures. You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks when dealing with creatures of Intelligence -3 or higher. You do not gain this bonus against a creature trained in the Psychic Shield arcanum. The bonus stacks with bonuses to interaction skills granted by the use of the Heart Reading arcanum.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Set-up (General)"></a>
<h4>Set-up (General)</h4>

<p>
You can transfer the benefits of a successful combat use of an interaction skill to an ally. For example, you can feint and allow your ally to make the surprise attack against that opponent. The interaction skill requires its normal time and skill check and you must be able to interact with your ally.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Shaping Talent (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Shaping Talent (Arcane)</h4>

<p>
You can learn shaping arcana. You can also use the Move Object, Psychic Shield, and Second Sight arcana untrained. See <a href="Arcana.html#Chapter 4: Arcana">Chapter 4: Arcana</a> for details.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Shield Penetration (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Shield Penetration (Arcane)</h4>

<p>
You're proficient at overcoming the resistance of Psychic Shields. You get a +2 bonus on checks to overcome a target's Psychic Shield. see <a href="Arcana.html#Chapter 4: Arcana - Psychic Shield">Psychic Shield</a> in Chapter 4 for more information.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Shield Training (General)"></a>
<h4>Shield Training (General)</h4>

<p>
You're trained in the proper use of shields in combat. You can use a shield and take only the standard penalties. Characters lacking Shield Training take their shield's armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all Strength and Dexterity-based checks.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Skill Affinity (General)"></a>
<h4>Skill Affinity (General)</h4>

<p>
Choose two skills to add to your list of favored skills. If you already know one or both of these skills, your rank in them increases to your favored skill rank based on your level.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Skill Focus (General)"></a>
<h4>Skill Focus (General)</h4>

<p>
Choose a known skill. You get a +3 bonus on all checks involving that skill. You can acquire this feat multiple times. Each time you do, it applies to a different known skill.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Skill Mastery (Expert)"></a>
<h4>Skill Mastery (Expert)</h4>

<p>
Choose four of your known skills. When making checks with those skills, you can take 10 even when distracted or under pressure. This feat does not allow you to take 10 with skills that do not normally allow you to do so. You can acquire this feat multiple times. Each time you do, choose four other known skills to master.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Skill Training (General)"></a>
<h4>Skill Training (General)</h4>

<p>
Each time you take this feat, you gain two additional known skills.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Slow Fall (Expert)"></a>
<h4>Slow Fall (Expert)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Jump rank 5 or higher.</i></p>
<p>
You can slow a fall if within arm's reach of a wall or similar structure. Subtract 10 feet from the fall per two expert levels before determining damage, with falls of 0 or less doing no damage. At 20th level expert you can use a nearby surface to slow your descent and fall any distance without harm.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Smite Foe (Martial)"></a>
<h4>Smite Foe (Martial)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Favored Foe.</i></p>
<p>
You can charge a blow with the power of your determination. You can use Smite Foe once per day per four levels, rounded up. When you strike a favored foe in melee, you can activate your smite: add your Charisma score to your attack roll and half your total level to your damage. If you accidentally smite an opponent who is not actually a favored foe, there is no additional effect, and the smite use is wasted.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Snatch Arrows (Expert)"></a>
<h4>Snatch Arrows (Expert)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Deflect Arrows.</i></p>
<p>
When using the Deflect Arrows feat, you may catch the weapon instead of just deflecting it. Thrown weapons can immediately be thrown back at the original attacker (even though it isn't your turn) or kept for later use.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Spirited Charge (Martial)"></a>
<h4>Spirited Charge (Martial)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Ride-By Attack.</i></p>
<p>
When mounted and using the charge action, you deal +3 damage with a melee weapon (+4 damage with a lance).
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Stunning Attack (Expert or Martial)"></a>
<h4>Stunning Attack (Expert or Martial)</h4>

<p>
When you make an unarmed attack, you can choose not to inflict normal damage. Instead, the target makes a Fortitude save against a Difficulty of 10 plus your unarmed damage bonus. A successful save results in no effect. A failed save means the target is dazed for one round. Failure by 5 or more means the target is stunned for one round, and failure by 10 or more renders the target unconscious.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Subtle Arcana (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Subtle Arcana (Arcane)</h4>

<p>
You can use your arcana with less chance of notice. When using arcana you can mute their signature. Characters using Second Sight cannot detect your power use nor can its use be detected later using Second Sight. A subtle power increases the fatigue save Difficulty by +2.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Suggest (Expert)"></a>
<h4>Suggest (Expert)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Fascinate (for the same skill).</i></p>
<p>
You can use an interaction skill to plant a suggestion in the mind of a subject you have fascinated using the Fascinate feat. This works like a use of the Suggestion power (see <a href="Arcana.html#Chapter 4: Arcana - Suggestion">Suggestion</a> in Chapter 4), except you must interact with the target and mental contact is not required. The Difficulty of the target's Will save is 10 + half your expert level + your Charisma score.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Summon Darkfiend (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Summon Darkfiend (Arcane)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Shaping Talent, 6th level adept or higher</i></p>
<p>
You can summon darkfiends, beings from the depths of Shadow, to serve you. This requires a check of 1d20 + adept level + your Charisma score with a Difficulty of 10 + twice the darkfiend's level. Summoning a 5th-level darkfiend is Difficulty 20, for instance. Summon Darkfiend is fatiguing (Difficulty 10 + the darkfiend's level). The summoned darkfiend will do your bidding for a number of days equal to your adept level before returning to Shadow. Summon Darkfiend is sorcery and requires a Corruption check. See <a href="Adversaries.html#Chapter 8: Adversaries">Chapter 8: Adversaries</a> for more on darkfiends.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Summon Elemental (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Summon Elemental (Arcane)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Shaping Talent, 6th level Adept or higher, trained in appropriate elemental shaping arcanum.</i></p>
<p>
You can summon an elemental, a spirit which animates a particular element. This requires a check using the appropriate shaping arcanum for that element (Water Shaping for water elementals, Fire Shaping for fire elementals, and so forth) with a Difficulty equal to 10 + twice the elemental's level. Summoning a 5th-level elemental is Difficulty 20, for instance. Summon Elemental is fatiguing (Difficulty 10 + the elemental's level). The summoned elemental will do your bidding for a number of rounds equal to your adept level before disappearing, leaving behind the now-inert element it used for its body. You must have some amount of the desired element to summon an elemental of that type. See <a href="Adversaries.html#Chapter 8: Adversaries">Chapter 8: Adversaries</a> for more on elementals.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Surprise Attack (Expert)"></a>
<h4>Surprise Attack (Expert)</h4>

<p>
When you make a surprise attack (see <a href="PlayingTheGame.html#Chapter 6: Playing the Game - Surprise Attack">Surprise Attack</a> in Chapter 6), you do +2 damage. You cannot surprise attack an opponent you cannot perceive (due to concealment or some other effect), and opponents immune to critical hits suffer no additional damage. Opponents who cannot be surprise attacked are also immune. You can take this feat multiple times, increasing your damage bonus by +2 each time, to a maximum of +10.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Talented (General)"></a>
<h4>Talented (General)</h4>

<p>
Choose two known and related skills, such as Survival and Sneak or Acrobatics and Climb, or two specialties from a specialty skill, such as Craft or Knowledge. You gain a +2 bonus with both skills. You can take this feat multiple times. Each time it applies to two different skills.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Taunt (General)"></a>
<h4>Taunt (General)</h4>

<p>
You can shake an opponent's confidence with clever taunts. Use a standard action and make a Bluff check against your target's Sense Motive check or Will saving throw, whichever has the higher bonus. If you succeed, your target is shaken for one round (-2 to attack rolls, checks, and saving throws, but not Toughness saves). If you fail, you may try again on the following round. Targets get a +1 on their resistance roll per Bluff attempt against them in the same scene (successful or not).
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Track (General)"></a>
<h4>Track (General)</h4>

<p>
You can find and follow tracks left by other creatures. To find tracks or to follow them for one mile requires a successful Survival check. You must make another Survival check each time the tracks become difficult to follow. You move at half your normal speed while tracking (or at your normal speed with a -5 penalty on the check, or at up to twice your normal speed with a -20 penalty on the check). The Difficulty depends on the surface, as given on the Surface table.

<p>
Very Soft Ground: Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) that holds deep, clear impressions of footprints.
</p>
<p>
Soft Ground: Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which a creature leaves frequent but shallow footprints.
</p>
<p>
Firm Ground: Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, woods, and the like) or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces (thick rugs and dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave some traces (broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only occasional or partial footprints.
</p>
<p>
Hard Ground: Any surface that doesn't hold footprints at all, such as bare rock or an indoor floor. Most streambeds fall into this category, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed away. The creature leaves only traces (scuff marks or displaced pebbles).
</p>
<p>
Several modifiers may apply to the Survival check, as given on the condition table.

<p>
If you fail a Survival check, you can retry after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.
</p>
<p>
Without this feat, you can use Survival to find tracks, but you can follow them only if the Difficulty is 10 or lower. You can use the Search skill to find a footprint or similar sign of a creature's passage using the Difficulties given above, but you can't use Search to follow tracks.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Trackless Step (General)"></a>
<h4>Trackless Step (General)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Trained in Sneak and Survival.</i></p>
<p>
If you choose, you leave no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Trample (General)"></a>
<h4>Trample (General)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Mounted Combat.</i></p>
<p>
When you attempt to overrun an opponent while mounted, your target may not choose to avoid you. Your mount may make one hoof attack against any target you knock down, gaining the standard +4 bonus on attack rolls against prone targets.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Trance (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Trance (Arcane)</h4>

<p>
Through breathing and bodily control, you can slip into a deep trance. It takes a minute of uninterrupted meditation and a Difficulty 15 Concentration check. While in the trance you add your Concentration bonus (not rank) to your Constitution score to determine how long you can hold your breath and you make Concentration checks rather than Constitution checks to avoid suffocation (see <a href="PlayingTheGame.html#Chapter 6: Playing the Game - Suffocation">Suffocation</a> in Chapter 6). Poison and disease effects are suspended for the duration of the trance. It requires a Notice check with a Difficulty equal to your Concentration check result to determine you're not dead. You are aware of your surroundings while in trance and can come out of the trance at any time at will. You cannot take any actions while in the trance.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Trapfinding (Expert)"></a>
<h4>Trapfinding (Expert)</h4>

<p>
You're skilled in finding and dealing with various sorts of traps. You can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty higher than 20 (without this feat, you can only find traps with Difficulties lower than 20). Most well-constructed traps have a Difficulty of at least 20. Finding an arcane trap has a Difficulty of 25 or higher. 
</p>
<p>
You can use Disable Device to disarm even arcane traps. This has a Difficulty of 25 or higher. If you beat a trap's Difficulty by 10 or more on a Disable Device check, you can study the trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it without actually disarming it.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Truth-Reading (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Truth-Reading (Arcane)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Sensitive, ability to use Heart Reading or Mind Touch arcana</i></p>
<p>
You can sense when someone is lying to you. When interacting with a creature of Intelligence -3 or higher, you automatically sense when the creature tells you a deliberate lie. You can do this a number of times equal to your Wisdom score in a given conversation.
</p>
<p>
Detecting further lies in the same conversation is very fatiguing (Difficulty 10, +1 per additional statement you verify). You do not detect half-truths, lies of omission, or things the creature believes are actually believes are true (even if they are not). Only actual conscious lies are detected.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Two-Weapon Defense (General)"></a>
<h4>Two-Weapon Defense (General)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Two-Weapon Fighting.</i></p>
<p>
Your two-weapon fighting style improves your Defense. When wielding two weapons (but not while unarmed) and using parry defense, you gain a +1 bonus to your Defense. When fighting defensively or using the full defense action, this bonus increases to +2.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Two-Weapon Fighting (General)"></a>
<h4>Two-Weapon Fighting (General)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Dexterity +2 or higher.</i></p>
<p>
You can fight skillfully with a weapon in each hand, giving you one extra attack per round. The attack roll with each weapon is at -4. If the off-hand weapon is a light weapon, the penalty is reduced to -2.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Uncanny Dodge (General)"></a>
<h4>Uncanny Dodge (General)</h4>

<p>
You are especially attuned to potential danger, whether through training, experience, or some innate arcane talent. You retain your dodge bonus to Defense when surprised, flat-footed, or surprise attacked, so long as you are able to react (are not helpless, bound, unconscious, and the like).
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Visionary Talent (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Visionary Talent (Arcane)</h4>

<p>
You can learn visionary arcana. You can also use the Psychic Shield, Second Sight, and Visions arcana untrained. See <a href="Arcana.html#Chapter 4: Arcana">Chapter 4: Arcana</a> for details.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Wealthy (General)"></a>
<h4>Wealthy (General)</h4>

<p>
Each time you select this feat, increase your Wealth bonus by +4.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Weapon Bind (Martial)"></a>
<h4>Weapon Bind (Martial)</h4>

<p>
If you are using a parry defense and an opponent misses you with an armed melee attack, you can make a disarm attempt immediately as a free action. The disarm attempt is carried out normally, including the attacker getting the opportunity to disarm you (unless you have the Improved Disarm feat).
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Weapon Break (Martial)"></a>
<h4>Weapon Break (Martial)</h4>

<p>
If you are using a parry defense and an opponent misses you with an armed melee attack, you can make an attack against your opponent's weapon immediately as a free action. This requires a normal attack roll and inflicts normal damage to the weapon if it hits (see <a href="PlayingTheGame.html#Chapter 6: Playing the Game - Sunder">Sunder</a> in Chapter 6 for details).
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Weapon Finesse (General)"></a>
<h4>Weapon Finesse (General)</h4>

<p>
When wielding a light weapon you can add your Dexterity score instead of your Strength score to your attack rolls.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Weapon Focus (General)"></a>
<h4>Weapon Focus (General)</h4>

<p>
Choose one type of weapon. You can choose unarmed strike or grapple as your weapon for purposes of this feat. You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls you make using the selected weapon. You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, it applies to a new type of weapon.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Weapon Specialization (Martial)"></a>
<h4>Weapon Specialization (Martial)</h4>

<p class="attr"><i>Prerequisite: Weapon Focus with the chosen weapon.</i></p>
<p>
Choose one type of weapon for which you have already selected the Weapon Focus feat. You deal +1 damage when using this type of weapon. You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, it applies to a new type of weapon.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Weapon Training (General)"></a>
<h4>Weapon Training (General)</h4>

<p>
You're trained in the proper use of martial weapons. Characters lacking Weapon Training suffer a -4 penalty on attack rolls with martial weapons.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Well-Informed (Expert)"></a>
<h4>Well-Informed (Expert)</h4>

<p>
You are exceptionally well informed. When encountering an individual, group, or organization for the first time, you can make an immediate Gather Information check as a reaction to see if your character has heard something about the subject. This takes the place of a normal Knowledge check (if any). Use the guidelines for Gather Information checks (see <a href="Skills.html#Chapter 2: Skills - Gather Information">Gather Information</a> in Chapter 2) to determine the level of information you gain, and the guidelines for Knowledge checks (see <a href="Skills.html#Chapter 2: Skills - Knowledge">Knowledge</a> in Chapter 2) for the sorts of questions you can answer. You receive only one check per subject, although the Narrator may allow another upon encountering the subject again once significant time has passed.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Widen Arcana (Arcane)"></a>
<h4>Widen Arcana (Arcane)</h4>

<p>
When using arcana that normally affect a single target, you can affect an area with a radius of up to twice your rank in feet. The power affects all targets in the area normally. You must still meet any requirements for range, including mental contact, the power requires. Make a single check and compare the results to each target in the area. Targets save individually against the power's effects. The widened power's fatigue Difficulty increases by +6.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Wild Empathy (General)"></a>
<h4>Wild Empathy (General)</h4>

<p>
You have a special connection with animals. You can use the Handle Animal skill (see <a href="Skills.html#Chapter 2: Skills - Handle Animal">Handle Animal skill</a>) like Diplomacy (see <a href="Skills.html#Chapter 2: Skills - Diplomacy">Diplomacy skill</a>) to change the attitude of an animal by interacting with it. Unlike a normal use of Diplomacy, you do not have to speak a language the animal understands, and Wild Empathy affects creatures with Intelligence -4 or less normally. You can also use the Bluff and Gather Information skills normally on animals. You don't actually need to speak to the animals; you communicate your intent through gestures and body language and learn things by studying animal behavior.
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Wild Talent (General)"></a>
<h4>Wild Talent (General)</h4>

<p>
You have a talent for a particular power, and can use it as if you know it at a rank equal to your total level +3. see <a href="Arcana.html#Chapter 4: Arcana">Chapter 4: Arcana</a> for details. You are not considered trained in the power for purposes of prerequisites and other traits.
</p>
<p>
You have less control over your Wild Talent than a truly trained adept does with arcana. Whenever you are under stress, you must make a Will saving throw against a Difficulty of 10 + half your total level. If you fail, you are stunned and your wild talent goes off randomly. The power has its normal effect, but the Narrator chooses its target and parameters (if any). You suffer normal fatigue from this wild use of arcana and cannot take any other action on the round it manifests. You can spend Conviction to automatically control a wild talent for one use.
</p>
<p>
If you acquire the power feat for the same power as your Wild Talent, you gain control over it and can use it normally. You can only have one Wild Talent. You cannot acquire this feat by spending Conviction (see <a href="HeroCreation.html#Chapter 1: Hero Creation - Conviction">Conviction</a> in Chapter 1).
</p>

<a name="Chapter 3: Feats - Wildwalk (General)"></a>
<h4>Wildwalk (General)</h4>

<p>
You can move through any sort of natural surroundings at your normal speed, unimpeded by things like undergrowth, difficult terrain, snow, mud, and similar difficulties (see <a href="PlayingTheGame.html#Chapter 6: Playing the Game - Hampered Movement">Hampered Movement</a> in Chapter 6). You're still affected by wind, rain, and other weather conditions, however.
