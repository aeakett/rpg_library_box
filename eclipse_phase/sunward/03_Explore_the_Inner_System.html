<p>Firewall operatives like yourself come from a wide variety of backgrounds. You may have been born the natural way back on Earth, hatched in a Martian exowomb crèche, or raised on a scum barge by an extended family of orangutans. As a sentinel, you’re going to be thrown head-first into a lot of diverse environments that you may not be accustomed to, especially if you’ve never interacted with the local culture or faction before. To prepare our agents for these sorts of scenarios, Firewall has prepared a collection of background reports to fill you in on local areas you may not be fully aware of. Some of these are reports filed by agents in the field, some are transcripts of summaries provided by agents after a specific op. Fair warning, each piece may or may not be tainted by the narrator’s own personal cognitive biases. Additionally, quite a bit of the subject matter deals with things that may be of particular interest to sentinels, but may not be confirmed. Some may simply be rumors, speculation, or deliberate disinformation spread by our rivals. So run everything through a cynicism filter until you’ve verified it yourself. Finally, these reports are just meant to provide some basic familiarity, they’re not comprehensive. If you need more data on a specific habitat, person, or group, ping the Solarchive or Firewall’s internal wiki. For more in-depth preparation, skillsofts or psychosurgery can also be provided.</p>

<p>This first batch of reports deals with the inner system, from the sun out to Mars. If it does its job, this information will help you avoid an unscheduled resleeve.</p>
