<h1 class="chapterHead" id="melt">Melt</h1>

<p>Hines lingered on an outcropping, not quite rock and not quite flow, dangling just a few meters above thick lava. His quartz morph glowed from the violent heat. In front of him, volcanic melt stretched out and curved upwards, the horizon distorted by the intense pressure of the Venusian surface atmosphere. Beyond the hazy curtain of rising heat, not even a square millimeter of solid ground was in sight. If he stayed too long on this gelatinous anomaly, his weight would sink it into the furnace below. The far crater edge existed out there somewhere, and beyond that, the surface mining camp. He’d been scouting terrain and mapping lava flow for hours, and the simple pleasure of shelter and solid surface beneath his six limbs was not on the schedule for a dozen more.</p>

<p>Hines stared into that orange hot morass of molten rock and considered, for a fleeting second, plunging head-first into it, putting a swift end to his misery. Literally made from quartz, his morph was designed to withstand the hellish heat and pressure here, but a fall into the searing lava would be lethal. Kymber sensed the morose direction of his thoughts and interjected with a sugar-sweet vocalization: [We have goals, Hines. Stay focused on them, and the time will melt steadily away. I promise.]</p>

<p>If he had beautiful digestive organs from which to expel partially-digested food through a wide open mouth, he’d have done so right then at the mention of the word &#8220;melt.&#8221; Often, he suspected his personal AI muse of intentionally trying to corrupt his mind with its choice of words, to tip him over the edge, but he was stuck with it, for now at least. Once his indentured hell was over, he’d be set, he’d be remade, he’d be amongst those privileged enough to sleeve in flesh. That is, of course, if he could survive.</p>

<p>Only a few weeks into his twelve-month contract and Hines had already witnessed three deaths. The egos of indentured surface workers were cheap and replaceable, much more so than the quartz morphs they were downloaded into, and they perished permanently on a consistent basis here. Even though surface mining contracts were the expedient route to earning a mid-range biomorph in the shortest period possible, Hines was now doubting he would ever survive the term with his sanity intact, let alone alive. If he was caught within a sudden swell of molten rock or crushed in a mining cave-in, his stack would be unrecoverable. Though the Octavian Mining Concern possessed a backup of his digitized consciousness, Hines was acutely aware that the hypercorp was exploiting a contractual loophole, labeling his backup as a fork with no legal rights or claim to Hines’s legacy. If he died, his &#8220;fork&#8221; would be signing a new contract and starting the term from scratch.</p>

<p>A week ago, Hines witnessed the demise of Clava, another indenture shelled inside a quartz morph, identical to his own. Only four days were left on her term. A drillbot teleoperator wasn’t paying attention, ground too deep, and undermined a pillar supporting a twenty-meter cave, collapsing the whole thing right on top of her. Hines bet that Clava didn’t even see it coming. She was probably too wrapped up in repetitive mining ops, dreaming of scratching her own flesh with the actual fingers she would soon have earned. Dreaming of any sensation beyond the searing heat reflecting off quartz limbs. Dreaming of coolness upon skin. Then, splat, oblivion. Hines laughed at the absurdity of it. For the poor, it was here one second, gone the next.</p>

<p>The teleops were the biggest threat to surface workers. What did they care? Those slugs tucked safely away in secure storage in the aerostats, high in the cloud cover. Their egos were snug and lazy, trading years and years of service for the long, riskless route to a cheap morph to call their own.</p>

<p>Hines was not going to let the same thing happen to him. He was not going to pay his dues, looking over his shoulder every second for extinction to club his ego. He was not going to let those fuckers slip up and erase him. He refused to become another Clava. He had escaped from perpetual service in the Consortium, pursued the dream offered here on Venus: indentured service for higher risk but a much shorter term and higher payout. He would survive. His fate would be firmly in his own control.</p>

<hr>

<p>Vijja laid back, the lush foam of the bed forming around sky blue skin, pillows slinking over and massaging their flesh, every surface in the chamber programmed to reflect back infinite naked Vijja, sleeved in their most precious morph, distinctly neuter and genderless. Vijja’s hands stroked across their skin, triggering specialized nerve clusters and releasing a rush of endorphins. Vijja much preferred to think of themself as an altogether new type of gender, outside the binary norms, with an alternative sense of sexuality and identity.</p>

<p>With a thought to their mute and nameless muse, Vijja’s writhing, reflected form faded away. A new reality washing over their sensorium. Vijja was now floating in zero-g bliss, buoyed by reflective clouds, surrounded by a perfect experience of the true glory of Venus: the cumulus of the habitable zone in the upper atmosphere, Vijja’s only beloved. The simulspace’s neurostimulators triggered, immersing Vijja in soft, cool sensations as wisps caressed their skin. The wind whispered in Vijja’s ears, the soft and steady breeze wrapping their body in an ethereal embrace. Cloud engulfed them, cool with electrostatic shock, then entered inside, leaking into every pore, expanding with ecstasy within. Sex with another gob of flesh could never compare.</p>

<p>Just as the purest pleasures of the sim kicked in, a call alert pushed past Vijja’s strict privacy filters. It was Rathe Aptuur, the highest-ranking diplomat in the Morningstar Constellation and Vijja’s mentor. With an exaggerated sigh, Vijja ordered their muse to cease the session and, as reality returned, to put Rathe through.</p>

<p>[I have news Vijja. It should please you.]</p>

<p>Despite the interruption, Vijja was always glad to hear from Rathe when her conversations began in this tone. It signified opportunity. And opportunity meant gain, both for themself and for Venus. Yet they couldn’t resist the urge to feign annoyance; it was part of the dance between they and Rathe. Vijja and Rathe both relished in it, but victory in these little exchanges was not paramount for Rathe. It was the play that mattered. Victory was everything. It was all Vijja had ever known.</p>

<p><em>Well, I was seeking my own pleasures when you found it necessary to interrupt. But I suppose my work is never done, is it?</em></p>

<p>Rathe chuckled. [Surly Vijja is undoubtedly my favorite Vijja.]</p>

<p><em>That may be, but surly Vijja would like to return to personal business. With all due respect, of course, Emissary Aptuur.</em> Again, a gambit in their play; Rathe despised it when Vijja addressed her with a title. The formality broke her heart. They had been through so much, as mentor and protégé, as rivals and colleagues, as lovers and enemies, then back again to their current status as the standard bearers for Venus.</p>

<p>Rathe opted to cease the banter, accept a tiny defeat, and get down to business. The fun had been quickly drained. The image of a woman, an exquisite sylph morph with skin the color of rust dusted with gold and eyes of emerald green displayed in Vijja’s entoptics. [Allow me to introduce you to the newest Consortium rep to be stationed here on Octavia. Her name is Jeue.]</p>

<p>Vijja smirked. <em>Never heard of her.</em></p>

<p>[No one has. And that is where the intrigue lies. And the challenge. She is due to arrive next week and you are to meet with her. Given the exit you provided the last few so unfortunate to hold her position, I predict an icy introduction.]</p>

<p>Vijja instructed their muse to do a mesh search. On immediate results, it found nothing but a press release announcing Jeue as the next Planetary Consortium rep to be sent to Octavia. No qualifications, no history. At first glance, she had not even existed until today.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this some kind of a joke, Rathe?&#8221; Vijja said aloud.</p>

<p>[No. Quite the opposite.] Rathe’s tone shifted, dark mockery coded over her vocals. [How will you destroy an adversary without a past? That is your weapon of choice, is it not? The secrets of the past?]</p>

<p><em>You should know by now not to doubt me, Emissary. That PC puppet will not last a month on this aerostat. Now, before I get to the task, I would appreciate some time alone to finish what I began with your exquisite gift.</em></p>

<p>[The cloud sim is a gift from the grateful populace of Venus, Vijja. Not I. You know I cannot play favorites.]</p>

<p><em>But you still do. And rightfully so.</em></p>

<p>[Farewell, Vijja.] With a smile and a nod, Rathe’s avatar blinked out of Vijja’s entoptics.</p>

<p>Vijja returned to the cumulus sim, the giddy anticipation of political maneuvering streaming through their circulatory system.</p>

<hr>

<p>&#8220;I want that fucking freak ruined. Finished. I don’t give a fuck what it takes. Any and all resources are at your disposal.&#8221; Charlie Boy sliced into the boiled fugu testes upon his plate, speared the white spongy delicacy, then slid the thin portion of blowfish balls between his enormous and perfectly white chompers. Swallow. The neurotoxins present in the testicles immediately began their assault on his system, forcing nerve endings to fire, tingle, then numb. The medichines in his blood counterattacked, nanobots neutralizing the poisonous invasion, converting death into euphoric endorphin swell. Thin lips from red, to lifeless blue, then back to red. He cracked his neck, side to side, satisfied, then continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I know I don’t need to remind you what the price of failure is.&#8221; Pause, another bite. &#8220;But I will. Cuz I’m a detail guy. I prefer clarity over ambiguity, and if I don’t make my intentions clear, I’m the fool.&#8221; Slice. Bite. Jeue waited patiently for the swallow, knowing what words were about to escape from beyond Charlie Boy’s obscene teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no you without me. I made your fucking ass, and I can take it all away. Snap. Snap.&#8221; Charlie Boy snapped his chubby cigar stained fingers twice quickly, echoing his words. &#8220;A nanosecond away from extinction. Don’t forget that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The opportunity of a lifetime, Charlie Boy. I’m aware.&#8221; Jeue raised a full cocktail glass of gold liquid to her gold lips, sipped. She swished the pure scotch around in her new mouth. The sensation of taste on a biomorph tongue overwhelmed her. She closed her eyes. It had been so long, over a decade. She wanted to scream in victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, yeah?&#8221; Charlie Boy asked, eyes all over Jeue’s lips as he instructed his muse to order her another one.</p>

<p>She swallowed the liquid, felt its burn spread over her vocal chords and down into her chest. She opened her emerald eyes. &#8220;Fuck yes.&#8221; She smiled warmly. Charlie Boy returned a hot cinder glare.</p>

<p>&#8220;This moment on, you watch yer fucking mouth, girl. Yer class now. Best this dusty rock has to offer. Leave</p>

<p>the back alley whore in the back alley. Kill her dead. Remember what you were before that, back before the Fall. I’m counting on you to be that world-class negotiator again, the one no one knew you were when your ego was beamed offworld and ended up in the triad’s databanks.&#8221; His point made, Charlie Boy’s put-on jovial demeanor flashed back onto his face. He took another bite of his dish, raised wild, not from a vat or nanofabbed, and gestured to the floor-to-ceiling window less than a meter from their table. From a hundred and fifty stories up, Valles-New Shanghai looked like a carpet of twinkling diamonds stretching to meet the deepening orange Martian sky of early evening. &#8220;Look out there. Tell me what you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jeue looked through her reflection. She polished her scotch just as the waiter placed down her next drink. She had never seen the canyon like this, from the heights, from the towers of wealth. Until today, she had only seen Mars from the inside of bunraku parlors and dollhouses, as viewed from the dead eyes of a pleasure pod waiting for the next client. She had no idea how her infugee ego had ended up in the syndicate’s hands or what had happened to her old friends and family from Earth. One day, she had been an up-and-coming UN negotiator, making sure to back herself up regularly as a precaution in the trying days of war and conflict. She must have died soon after that, in the Fall, but her backup was transmitted offworld. The next she knew, she was a slave, a prostitute, just another mind in a box downloaded into the body of choice according to the sexual appetites and fantasies of a non-stop parade of creeps.</p>

<p>Katarine, as she still called herself, despite the triad’s efforts to keep her nameless, was a survivor. She made the best of her circumstances. The skill set she required wasn’t all that different from what she had trained in for years. All she needed was an opening, and she found one: Charlie Boy. From client to friend, friend to savior. He had seen through her mask to the potential underneath, the genius of her charm. He paid the triad for details, investigated her past, and found an opportunity. He saw that her talents, her old training were being wasted. A plan came to mind in which her lack of a background was an asset.</p>

<p>Charlie, a behind-the-scenes player in the Consortium’s foreign consulate, answering directly to powers within the Ministry and Hypercorp Council, was waiting for her answer. Her chameleon nature came to the fore, manipulating herself to be exactly what he wanted her to be. &#8220;I see all the little people, Charlie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charlie Boy smiled, satisfied with the response. His demeanor and mannerisms often struck Jeue as oldfashioned, more in tune with the style of the Old Boys Network so prominent in old-Earth corps, but here he was, a major player for the cutting-edge hypercorps. He was a survivor as well, but far more ruthless and cold, the kind who used and sacrificed others to stay ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya know what I see?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I see the greatest empire this system has ever known, and will ever know. Not everyone sees it my way, Jeue. And it pisses me off to no end. If we’re not careful, we’re gonna lose our grip. I can see it. Thousands of microscopic cuts already, with more springing up each day. The anarchists, the Venusians, the reclaimers … we keep seeping blood, drip by drip, and it’s pooling up. Eventually, we’ll collapse to our knees, and soon after that the PC is face-down dead in its own juice. It’s our turn to strike back, starting with Vijja and these Morningstar troublemakers, and it’s gonna be done my way. When I sting, it’s hard and it’s death. You will know it. That’s the way it should be. Sneaky ain’t noble. If I’m gonna fuck you, you’re gonna lose your head. Gaping hole in your chest.&#8221;</p>

<hr>

<p>Vijja sat still within their private box at the apex of the cloud-diving observation dome, a clenched fist resting softly on their lips, awaiting the arrival of their guest and newly-appointed rival from the Planetary Consortium. Vijja had opted to wear one of the latest unique designs from Branimira Ivanova, a ground-breaking fashion house on Gerlach, in Venusian orbit. This show of opulence and influence was intended to make waves in the media and socialite circles, marking their meeting as a notable event, scoring points for Vijja as the more stylish and elegant. It was a bold move to choose fashion over formal attire, and Vijja hoped it would grab hold of Jeue’s confidence from the first moment and shake it like a misbehaving puppy. Instead, Vijja’s gambit had fallen victim to a perfectly-timed disaster.</p>

<p>The news of this disaster saturated the mesh in minutes. The cortical stacks of over three dozen surface workers deemed unrecoverable by the Octavian government following a mining disaster, an explosion at the third largest operations base during a shift change, origin unknown. Dozens of desperate indentures smuggled from Consortium hands in pursuit of the dream of a new morph and a new life on Venus were wiped. Each one of the deceased had waived backup storage costs and liabilities that would have extended their terms, and had been unable to afford backups of their own. Dozens permanently, irrevocably dead. Comment streams were scathing and multiplying by the second, increasingly fierce, a feeding frenzy of anti-Morningstar sentiment. The outrage spanned all social strata throughout the entire system.</p>

<p>And here was Vijja, a public face of the Constellation, the eyes of the dome upon them, broadcast across the mesh and around the system, dressed in extravagant finery, their appearance almost perfectly timed with the news. Absorbed together, it was as if Vijja was celebrating the tragedy. Their reputation was already taking a hit as scathing comments flooded the social networks, remarking on Vijja’s look and attire as the height of bad taste and a shocking lack of decorum. Their name was being mocked and reviled.</p>

<p>Vijja smirked slightly beneath their still fist. The first volley had been fired and they were already on the defensive. <em>What bad form</em>, Vijja thought. <em>An assault even before a formal introduction. I would expect nothing less from an amateur.</em> Vijja ordered their muse to extinguish the comment streams scrolling across their entoptics. Peace was needed in these few final moments before Vijja would extend their hand in greeting to Jeue. Minutes, perhaps even seconds, to center their venom, to suppress their seething need to counterstrike immediately. But there would be no time for focus.</p>

<p>The door to the box slid open. Vijja stood and turned to greet their guest, the warmest of smiles gracing their lips and eyes, not a hint of defeat or hate, but only two Octavian diplomatic escorts entered the room. They nodded stiffly, then one spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Emissary Vijja. Diplomat Jeue sends her regrets, but she will not be able to attend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vijja turned their back to the escorts and dismissed them with a wave of their hand as they ordered their muse to reignite the comment streams and search the mesh for any activity from Jeue. A video statement, posted just seconds ago, emerged, and there was Jeue:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to extend my deepest sympathies to the loved ones of all those lost in the terrible tragedy that took place today on the surface of Venus.&#8221; Her bright green eyes flickered from pools of sympathy to fires of great hate as her speech rolled onward, slamming into the Morningstar Constellation. She vehemently denounced the &#8220;get-rich-quick&#8221; appeal of the Morningstar indentured contracts. She repeated, following every point, &#8220;Is the risk really worth the reward?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vijja’s mind snarled and snapped. <em>So calculated, so rehearsed, zero sophistication and subtlety. A manufactured politician, not an artist.</em></p>

<p><em>I am the artist. And it’s time to get creative.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>The exchange lasted for months. On the surface, Consortium-Constellation relations continued on their normal rocky course. Under the surface, a tug-of-war ensued, with each side engaging ploys and launching memetic attacks. A leading scientific proponent of the Consortium’s original terraforming plans for Venus publicly switched sides, coming out in favor of the Constellation’s Aerial Terraforming Initiative, devaluing the Consortium’s claims. A major outer system shipper canceled its contract with the Constellation to move several iceteroids into the inner system to be sublimated in the Venusian atmosphere and aid the aerial terraforming, raising the costs and shaking public confidence in the Constellation’s goals. Negotiations over intellectual property restrictions, pushed heavily by Consortium interests, stalled and then stalled again, impeding the interests of certain hypercorps in establishing standards across the inner system. An incident with a Constellation citizen found to be manufacturing restricted weapons onboard a Consortium habitat brought down condemnation of the Venusian’s lax attitudes towards nanoproliferation. Blowby-blow it continued.</p>

<p>Through it all, however, Vijja had failed to find an avenue by which to undermine Jeue directly. This was their specialty, but the Consortium diplomat’s hidden past provided precious little for the negotiator to work with. This lack itself may have been an angle to exploit, but Vijja was convinced the Consortium anticipated such a move and had a response in place. Jeue’s insertion and reception into the circles of hyperelite socialites and glitterati had been flawless, and her travels through their ranks had been studiously free of controversy, despite several pitfalls and traps Vijja had laid.</p>

<p>As Vijja immersed themself in a sensuous steam bath, contemplating new angles of approach to this vexing situation, their muse suddenly flagged a new incoming file as exceptionally relevant to Vijja’s interests. Vijja called up the entoptic details, and was immediately stricken by the file’s name: &#8220;Weapon of Choice.&#8221; This was not a message from Rathe, however. The sender was anonymous, the trail carefully and completely obfuscated, as it always was. Vijja smiled knowingly. This was an opportunity, a gift. Vijja had grown accustomed to these occasional mysteries, these provident bonuses, throughout their rise to the top of the Morningstar diplomatic ranks. Their timing never failed to be fortuitous and their contents always proved cataclysmically destructive to Vijja’s adversaries. Vijja had always questioned and carefully validated their contents, and they had always proved true.</p>

<p><em>Thank you once again</em>, Vijja thought, towards no one in particular, but rather into the vastness of the mesh. Vijja was not one to question their benefactor’s desire for anonymity.</p>

<p>The file opened and the truth of Jeue’s past spilled forth like blood from a gut slice.</p>

<p>Jeue: a chameleon, in hiding for years, plotting all the while. Brilliant, yet mad beyond comparison. She was a sleeper, a ticking time bomb, a reprogrammed and rewired threat. Her past was bathed in blood, and her kind were as dangerous as they were notorious. Murderers. Decapitators. Flesh eaters. Lost.</p>

<hr>

<p>The deed was done. Jeue’s past had been unveiled. The scandal unfolded in the most breathtaking manner Vijja had managed to devise. Her past was all over the feeds. The Consortium was disgraced for allowing a monster in their ranks. Jeue herself had disappeared, gone underground in face of an almost certain order of death and deletion of all backups.</p>

<p>Vijja’s gleeful absorption of the breaking news was suddenly interrupted by an incoming call alert. Annoyed at their muse for allowing the disturbance past their filters, Vijja was about to refuse it when it suddenly connected. An avatar appeared in their entoptics that they had never seen before. It was unusual, unique, and sinister: a hand stretched wide in tension, the fingertips shaped like scorpion tails. With a sobering certainty, Vijja knew that their anonymous benefactor was finally making themselves known.</p>

<p>The hand spoke in a deep vocalization with the unmistakable rasp of a throat abused for ages by all the harmful substances a body could ingest.</p>

<p>[Pleased?]</p>

<p><em>Yes. Very much.</em></p>

<p>[And what if I told you that none of the information I provided this time was true, yet I went to considerable effort for it all to be verifiable and airtight?]</p>

<p><em>Then I would be even more delighted.</em></p>

<p>As much as Vijja enjoyed digging up the past and skewering an enemy upon it, they adored complex fabrications and deceit. It was the true art of their chosen profession. No one ever earned the title of mastermind by dealing wholly in truths.</p>

<p>The hand continued. [There is something you must understand, Vijja. That I never want you to forget. You are a creation, of mine, of others. Your rise has little to do with you.]</p>

<p>Vijja hissed aloud. It was nearly impossible to rattle them, but this shocked the diplomat into a search for words, for the proper response to this entity, whoever it was. All Vijja could muster was: I don’t believe you.</p>

<p>[That would be foolhardy. Have I not provided for you, Vijja? Protected you? Guided you? Removed obstacles from your path?] Vijja remained silent, unwilling to challenge or to show weakness. They did not want to provide even a word that could be used against them. This was the start of the fight to remain in the arms of existence. The battle with Jeue paled sickeningly in comparison to the contest</p>

<p>Vijja could sense unfolding with the wide-reaching hand. The hand spoke again. [Do you require proof Vijja? Is that it? To be fair, I would ask for proof in your position. Would you</p>

<p>like to ask for proof, Vijja?]</p>

<p>This time Vijja did not hesitate. Yes. I require proof. [Very well, Vijja. Here is your proof.] A new file was transferred. Vijja eyed the title in their</p>

<p>entoptic display. Weapon of Choice. Warmth drained from their body.</p>

<p>Barely aware that they were doing so, Vijja opened the file and examined the contents. Every claim that was made in the previous file against Jeue now became Vijja. A lifelog of the horrors perpetrated by the young woman known as Hera79 during her accelerated growth in the Futura project flooded Vijja’s display. Their mind entered a state of paralysis as the images attacked: the bloodsoaked faces, the limbs, the carve of blades through youthful flesh. Vijja could recall the taste of bone and feel the scream of insatiable hunger rising from her throat, then and now. All those terrible, invigorating moments stolen from her, returned in a fantastic, raging torrent. Hera79 was changed, reprogrammed, groomed into … who? Jeue? Vijja? Anyone? Vijja could no longer tell.</p>

<p>The entire fabric of Vijja’s reality was unraveling. They collapsed to the floor in shock and exhaustion.</p>

<p>The hand was all that was present in Vijja’s augmented reality, the rest was haze.</p>

<p>[Remember this, Vijja. Your past, your position, your power, all are under my control. I have vast wealth and resources at my disposal. I am old enough to guess what you are thinking three moves ahead. My influence is not open, but is worked through others such as yourself. When I call, you will listen. When I command, you will obey.]</p>

<p>Vijja could not move. They did not want to have even a single thought, for fear that the hand would steal it and use it against them.</p>

<p>[Remember, Vijja. Remember.]</p>

<hr>

<p>Kymber whispered something in Hines’s mind and he began counting. <em>180. 179. 178.</em></p>

<p>Barely aware that he was doing so, he turned and began walking away from the mining camp. In his mind, he no longer railed against the injustices piled upon infugees and indentures like himself. He no longer castigated the system of power within the inner system that traded lives as commodities, that forced living beings into virtual slavery and hellish conditions. He forgot about the rich elites who callously made decisions that negatively affected millions of lives with no empathy or care as to the consequences. Hines mind was entirely devoted to his imminent detonation.</p>

<p>The code whispered by Kymber had triggered dormant programming in Hines’s brain, implanted with careful and subtle psychosurgical tricks, back when he was a disembodied infomorph in Consortium control. Hines’s incentive to free himself from the Consortium and seek indentured service on Venus had been fueled by this conditioning. Also buried in his subconscious were orders to blow up the mining station at a predetermined time, just half an hour from now. Kymber’s message to Hines, however, had triggered an abort sequence.</p>

<p><em>72. 71. 70.</em></p>

<p>Hines’s quartz morph lumbered along, practically running, though its movement was still stiff and slow. He had moved over 100 meters and was approaching the crater lip and the lava field beyond. He was far enough away now that the explosives hidden inside his quartz frame would not significantly damage the other surface workers or mining camp, as they were originally intended to do.</p>

<p><em>25. 24. 23.</em></p>

<p>He reached the lip. For a moment he paused, and Hines’s thoughts were once again absorbed by the radiant glow of burning rock below. For a second, he had no thoughts of his circumstances or the manipulations of people stationed far above him.</p>

<p><em>12. 11. 10.</em></p>

<p>He stepped out. For a long moment, he hovered above the melt. Then he fell.</p>

<hr>

<p>Vijja stood at their chamber window, watching the thick gray storm clouds rushing by. Rathe had wanted to see Vijja tonight, to congratulate them with another gift from the people, more exquisite and tantalizing than the cloud sim, but Vijja was not in the mood. Though these moments of atmospheric rage were rare, they chilled Vijja, filled them with melancholy and fear. They reminded them of the haze and the hand. This was not Vijja’s soft Venus. The destructive force of their world at its most temperamental was apparent even behind the protection of meter-thick aerogel. Vijja always thought of themself as the destroyer, the protector. They felt betrayed, insignificant.</p>

<p>Vijja had received credit for discovering and unveiling the plot to sabotage yet another Venusian mining operation. They had not lifted a finger, but the data had come from their office. A potential attack on a critical Morningstar mining camp thwarted by the ever-vigilant Vijja, hero of the Venusian people. Plotted by the scoundrel Jeue, a Lost Generation murderer in hiding.</p>

<p><em>It’s simple, really, to wind up on the winning side when you’ve created the winner. And the loser.</em></p>

<p>Vijja commanded the shades to lower and the lights to dim, then walked away from the window to sit in the darkness. They contemplated the life of the undying rich, the power and guile such oligarchs commanded.</p>

<p><em>It is only a matter of time. Only a matter of time before I am disposable. Before the decision is made to cast me into ruin.</em></p>

<p><em>What to do? What to do?</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Katarine found herself in the dollhouse parlor once again, sleeved into a new pod. She took a moment to examine herself. It was always unnerving to find herself in a new body, a new face, but she also relished these short periods of embodiment. Anything beat the eternity of waiting in simulspace. She wondered who her client would be this time. She was unaware that she was ever Jeue, that Charlie Boy had used her, once again, or that he would continue to, over and over again.</p>

<p><em>The next time I see Charlie Boy, she thought, I’m gonna take him up on that offer. Whatever it is, I don’t care. I just don’t care. Anything is better than this. She accessed her schedule to see when he was due, but there was nothing.</em></p>

<p><em>He’ll show up</em>, she thought. <em>He always does.</em></p>

<p>Seconds later she was ushered off to her appointment—another mid-level hypercorp drone with a fetish for humiliation.</p>

<hr>

<p>Charlie Boy strolled by a roulette table, stopped for a second to observe the action, to get a read on the play, and he caught a pattern he liked. A streak was about to hit according to his newly installed high-end math boost software. He beamed a bet of ten thousand credits to the dealer. The wheel spun.</p>

<p>He liked the look of the pleasure pod at the far end of the table. The pod gave him the eye and Charlie Boy walked up behind and pressed in close, his torso brushing lightly against the pod’s smooth bare back. &#8220;Watch this.&#8221; Charlie Boy said, and the pod flicked a pouty-lipped smile over the shoulder. The wheel started to slow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whaddya think? Think this bet has a shot?&#8221; Charlie Boy whispered into the pod’s ear while rattling the ice cubes in his glass of scotch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don’t know. Does it?&#8221; the pod replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah. I’m pretty sure it does.&#8221; He slammed the remaining half of his drink as the final clicks of the wheel started their march, ticktickticktick … ticktick … ticktick … tick … tick … tick …</p>

<p>The wheel stopped. As the dealer called out the winner, Charlie Boy bellowed from his cigar-charred throat, &#8220;Boom, baby! BOOM!&#8221;</p>
