<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >We humans have a special way of pulling ourselves up and kicking ourselves down at the same time. We&#8217;d achieved
more progress than ever before, at the cost of wrecking our planet and destabilizing our own governments. But
things were starting to look up.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   With exponentially accelerating technologies, we reached out into the solar system, terraforming worlds and
seeding new life. We re-forged our bodies and minds, casting off sickness and death. We achieved immortality
through the digitization of our minds, resleeving from one biological or synthetic body to the next at will. We
uplifted animals and AIs to be our equals. We acquired the means to build anything we desired from the molecular
level up, so that no one need want again.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   Yet our race toward extinction was not slowed, and in fact received a machine-assist over the precipice. Billions
died as our technologies rapidly bloomed into something beyond control ... further transforming humanity into
something else, scattering us throughout the solar system, and reigniting vicious conflicts. Nuclear strikes,
biowarfare plagues, nanoswarms, mass uploads ... a thousand horrors nearly wiped humanity from
existence.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   We still survive, divided into a patchwork of restrictive inner system hypercorp-backed oligarchies and libertarian
outer system collectivist habitats, tribal networks, and new experimental societal models. We have spread to the
outer reaches of the solar system and even gained footholds in the galaxy beyond. But we are no longer
solely &#8220;human&#8221; ... we have evolved into something simultaneously more and different&#8212; something
transhuman.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x4-70002.1"></a>Starting out</h3>
<!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >Eclipse Phase is a post-apocalyptic roleplaying game of transhuman conspiracy and horror. Humans are enhanced
and improved, but humanity is battered and bitterly divided. Technology allows the re-shaping of bodies and minds
and liberates us from material needs, but also creates opportunities for oppression and puts the capability for mass
destruction in the hands of everyone. Many threats lurk in the devastated habitats of the Fall, dangers both familiar
and alien.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x4-80002.1.1"></a>What is a roleplaying game?</h4>
<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >Have you ever read a book or seen a movie or a television show where a character does something really stupid, like
heading into a basement at night when the character knows the serial killer is around? The whole time, you&#8217;re
thinking: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t walk down those creepy stairs to the dark basement, especially without a flashlight. I&#8217;d do X,
Y, or Z instead!&#8221; Since you&#8217;re in the passenger&#8217;s seat for the plot you&#8217;re reading or watching, however, you simply
have to sit back and let it unfold.
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   What if you could take hold of the driver&#8217;s seat? What if you could take the plot in the direction you&#8217;d choose?
That is the essence of a roleplaying game.
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   A roleplaying game (or RPG, for short) is part improvisational theater, part storytelling, and part game. A
single person (the gamemaster) runs the game for a group of players that pretend to be characters in a fictitious
world. The world could be a mystery game set in the 1920s that takes you adventuring around the globe, a fantasy
realm inhabited by dragons and trolls and sword-wielding barbarians, or a science fiction setting with aliens and
spaceship and world-crushing weaponry. The players pick a setting that they find cool and want to play in. The
players then craft their own characters, providing a detailed history and personality to bring each to life. These
characters have a set of statistics (numerical values) that represent skills, attributes, and other abilities. The
gamemaster then explains the situation in which the characters find themselves. The players, through their
characters, interact with the storyline and each others&#8217; characters, acting out the plot. As the players
roleplay through some scenarios, the gamemaster will probably ask a given player to roll some dice and
the resulting numbers will determine the success or failure of a character&#8217;s attempted action. The
gamemaster uses the rules of the game to interpret the dice rolls and the outcome of the character&#8217;s
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
actions.
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   As a group exercise, the players control the storyline (the adventure), which evolves much like any movie or book
but within the flexible plot created by the gamemaster. This gamemaster plot provides a framework and ideas
for potential courses of action and outcomes, but it is simply an outline of what might happen&#8212;it
is not concrete until the players become involved. If you don&#8217;t want to walk down those stairs, you
don&#8217;t. If you think you can talk yourself out of a situation in place of pulling a gun, then try and
make it happen. The script of any roleplaying session is written by the players, and the story, based
upon the character&#8217;s actions and their responses to the events of the plot, will constantly change and
evolve.
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   The best part is that there is no &#8220;right&#8221; or &#8220;wrong&#8221; way to play an RPG. Some games may involve more combat
and dice rolling-related situations, where other games may involve more storytelling and improvised dialogue to
resolve a situation. Each group of players decides for themselves the type and style of game they enjoy
playing!
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x4-90002.1.2"></a>What is transhumanism?</h4>
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >Transhumanism is a term used synonymously to mean &#8220;human enhancement.&#8221; It is an international cultural and
intellectual movement that endorses the use of science and technology to enhance the human condition, both
mentally and physically. In support of this, transhumanism also embraces using emerging technologies to eliminate
the undesirable elements of the human condition such as aging, disabilities, diseases, and involuntary death. Many
transhumanists believe these technologies will be arriving in our near future at an exponentially accelerated pace
and work to promote universal access to and democratic control of such technologies. In the long scheme of things,
transhumanism can also be considered the transitional period between the current human condition and
an entity so far advanced in capabilities (both physical and mental faculties) as to merit the label
&#8220;posthuman.&#8221;
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   As a theme, transhumanism embraces heady questions. What defines human? What does it mean to defeat
death? If minds are software, where do you draw the line with programming them? If machines and animals can also
be raised to sentience, what are our responsibilities to them? If you can copy yourself, where does
&#8220;you&#8221; end and someone new begin? What are the potentials of these technologies in terms of both
oppressive control and liberation? How will these technologies change our society, our cultures, and our
lives?
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1.3   </span> <a 
 id="x4-100002.1.3"></a>Post-apocalyptic, conspiracy and horror themes</h4>
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Several themes pervade Eclipse Phase, some of which the reader may not be intimately familiar with. The following
helps define these themes so that as play ers read further into this rulebook, they gain a solid understanding of how
Eclipse Phase builds on such themes to create its unique setting.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   Post-apocalyptic is a term used to describe fiction set after a cataclysmic event has ended human civili zation as
we know it (usually accompanied by loss of human life on an almost unthinkable scale). The exact mechanism of the
disaster is usually unimportant nuclear war, plague, asteroid strike, and so on. The importance of the theme is the
human condition. If the world we know is torn away from us and humans suffer horrors beyond imagining in this
transforma tion to a post-apocalyptic setting, how does human ity cope? Do we survive and thrive and overcome?
Or do we lose our own humanity in the process, o ultimately fall to extinction? Those are the questions that drive
this genre.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   To conspire means &#8220;to join in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or to use such means to
accomplish a lawful end.&#8221; As such, a con spiracy theory attributes the ultimate cause of an event or a chain of
events (whether political, societa or historical) to a secret group of individuals with immense power (including
political, wealth and so on) who hide their activities from public view while manipulating events to achieve their
goals, regard less of consequences. Many conspiracy theories contend that a host of the greatest events of history
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
were initiated and ultimately controlled by such secret organizations. Of equal importance is the silent struggle
between clandestine groups, waging a secret war behind the scenes to determine who influences the
future.
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   Horror takes many forms, but in Eclipse Phase it is more psychological than gore. It is the uncertainty of
survival, the suspense of finding malevolent things among the stars, the fear of the unknown, the dread of
facing Things That Should Not Be, the revulsion when encountering alien things, and the sickening
realization of the wrong and ghastly things that transhumans are capable of doing to themselves and
each other. Horror also arises both from the comprehension that there are scary things beyond our
understanding nhabiting our universe and that transhumanity may be its own worst enemy. Despite all of the
technological tools and advances available to future transhumans, they still face terrors like losing control of
their own dentities, their perceptions, and their mental faculties&#8212;not to mention their future as a
species.
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   Eclipse Phase takes all of these themes and weaves them together in a transhuman setting. The postapocalyptic
angle covers the understanding of all that transhumanity has lost, the fight against extinction, and how much of that
is a struggle against our own nature. The conspiracy side delves into the nature of the secret organizations that play
key roles n determining transhumanity&#8217;s future and how the actions of determined individuals can change the ives of
many. The horror perspective explores the results of humanity&#8217;s self-inflicted transformations and how some of these
changes effectively make us non-human. Tying it all together is an awareness of the massive indifference and the
terrible alien-ness that pervades the universe and how transhumanity is insignificant against such a
backdrop.
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   Offsetting these themes, however, Eclipse Phase also asserts that there is still hope, that there is still something
worth fighting for, and that transhumanity can pave its own path toward the future.
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1.4   </span> <a 
 id="x4-110002.1.4"></a>But how do you actually play?</h4>
<!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" >To play a game of Eclipse Phase, you need the following:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">A group of players and a place to meet (real life or online!)
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">One player to act as the gamemaster
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The contents of this book
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Something for everyone to take notes with (note pads, laptops, whatever!)
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Two 10-sided dice per player (or a digital equivalent)
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Imagination</li></ul>
<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x4-120002.1.4"></a>A group of players and a place to meet</h5>
<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >While roleplaying games are flexible enough to allow any number of people, most gaming groups number around
four to eight players. That number of people brings a good mix of personalities to the table and ensures great
cooperative play.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   Once a group of players have determined to play Eclipse Phase, they&#8217;ll need to designate someone as the
gamemaster (see below). Then they&#8217;ll need to determine a time and place to meet.
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   Most roleplaying groups meet once a week at a regularly scheduled time and place: 7:00 PM, Thursday night,
Rob&#8217;s house, for example. However, each group determines where, how they&#8217;ll play, and how often. One group may
decide they can only get together once a month, while another group is so excited to dive into the story potential of
Eclipse Phase that they want to meet twice a week (they decide to rotate between their houses, though, so as not to
overload a particular player). If a group is lucky enough to have a favorite local gaming store that supports instore
play, the group might meet there. Other gaming groups meet in libraries, common rooms at their school, bookstores
that have generously-sized &#8220;reading rooms,&#8221; quiet restaurants, and so on. Whatever fits for your gaming group,
make it work!
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   When getting together for a game, most RPGs use the phrase &#8220;gaming session.&#8221; The length of each gaming
session is completely dependent upon the consensus of the playing group, as well as the limitations of the locale
where they&#8217;re playing. The particular story that unfolds in a given session can also impact a session&#8217;s length. If
playing in a game store, the group may only have a four-hour slot and the gamemaster and group may
have determined&#8212;through several sessions of play&#8212;that this is a perfect time frame to enjoy the
story they&#8217;re participating in each week. Another group, however, may want an even shorter length of
time. Yet another group may decide that while they&#8217;ll usually do four-hour sessions, once a month
they&#8217;ll set aside an entire Saturday for a great all-day gaming session. Players will need to dive in
and start playing and be flexible to decide what will provide the ultimate enjoyment for their gaming
group.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   While the camaraderie of a shared experience of playing face-to-face with a group of friends remains the strength
of roleplaying games, groups need not confine themselves to a single mode of play. There are myriad options that
can be used. Email, instant messages, message boards, video chats, phone/voip calls, text messages, wikis,
(micro-)blogs: any and all of these can be utilized to play the game without having warm bodies in seats directly
across the table from one another.
<!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   Finally, when playing groups meet for the first time, they should generate their characters (as opposed to
generating characters by themselves). While a gaming group can decide to generate characters individually, often it
is far easier once the players are together. This allows those more experienced in roleplaying games to help those
new to RPGs. Even more important, it enables the entire group to tailor the characters so there is
not too much overlap in capabilities and style. After all, with the wealth of character opportunities
available, you don&#8217;t want to show up at the table with an almost identical character to the player next to
you.
<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x4-130002.1.4"></a>The gamemaster</h5>
<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >Once a group has been organized, someone needs to step up and take the reins of the gamemaster. Some groups
have a single gamemaster that runs all their gaming sessions month after month. Other groups rotate a gamemaster,
with a single gamemaster running a given portion of the unfolding story for several sessions before
handing the work off to another player. Once again, the participants should be flexible. Some groups may
have the perfect person who loves the work involved and is more than willing to run session after
session, while other groups may decide that they all want to take turns both as the gamemaster and as
players.
<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   The gamemaster controls the story. They keep track of what is supposed to happen when, describes events as
they occur so that the players (as characters) can react to them, keep track of other characters in the game (referred
to as non-player characters, or NPCs), and resolve attempts to take action using the game system. The game system
comes into play when characters seek to use their skills or otherwise do something that requires a test to see whether
or not they succeed. Specific rules are presented for situations that involve rolling dice to determine the outcome
(see Game Mechanics, p. 112).
<!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   The gamemaster describes the world as the characters see it, functioning as their eyes, ears, and other senses.
Gamemastering is not easy, but the thrill of creating an adventure that engages the other players&#8217; imaginations,
testing their gaming skills and their characters&#8217; skills in the game world, makes it worthwhile. Posthuman Studios
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
and Catalyst Game Labs will follow the publication of Eclipse Phase with supporting supplements and adventures
to help this process along, but experienced gamemasters can always adapt the game universe to suit their own
styles. In fact, since Eclipse Phase is published under a Creative Commons License (see p. 5), players are encouraged
to tailor the universe to their style of play and also to share that with other players. You never know when a specific
choice you&#8217;ve made in the running of a campaign is exactly what another gamemaster and his group is looking
for.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x4-250002.1.4"></a>Taking notes</h5>
<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >Whether a gamemaster or player, you&#8217;ll need a way to track information. Players will be generating characters and
making changes to those characters from session to session. Meanwhile, the gamemaster will have a host of
information to track: notes on how the story is unfolding due to player character interaction that you&#8217;ll
need to fold into next week&#8217;s session; changes to NPCs; changes to player characters that the players
are not yet aware off (such as a character has been mind hacked but doesn&#8217;t yet know it); and so
on.
<!--l. 126--><p class="indent" >   Additionally, some groups enjoy a synopsis of each session that can be compiled and read at a later time in order
to enjoy and share their exploits, just as you might fileshare clips from your favorite video game to show off
your skill in taking the bad guy down (traditionally this has been called &#8220;bluebooking&#8221;). This can be
particularly useful if a player was unable to attend a given session, providing a quick re-cap that they
can read before attending the next gaming session and thus avoiding a bog-down up-front as that
player tries to catch up on current events in the game. The session scribe can be a shared responsibility
or assigned, all based upon what a given playing group finds works best for them. Likewise, some
gaming groups audiorecord their entire game session, both for later reference and for &#8220;actual play&#8221;
podcasts.
<!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >   The old standard of a pencil and paper still works wonders. A host of additional technologies, however, provide
many new options for players. From a text file on a laptop to a shared wiki, the ability to track large amounts of
information in a quick and useful fashion&#8212;while simultaneously making appropriate information available to
each player from session to session&#8212;significantly decreases how much time everyone needs to spend
tracking information. That time can now be redirected into the enjoyment of participating in a great
story.
<!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x4-260002.1.4"></a>Dice</h5>
<!--l. 134--><p class="noindent" >As described in the Game Mechanics section (p. 112), two ten-sided dice are required to play Eclipse Phase. While
most players enjoy the feel of tossing dice onto a table, there are many other mechanisms for rolling two ten-sided
dice to achieve a 00 to 99 result. Players who make heavy use of any online technologies for game play&#8212;such as
using online chatting or video blogging&#8212;should find it easy to track down and implement a quick dice-rolling
program.
<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x4-270002.1.4"></a>Imagination</h5>
<!--l. 140--><p class="noindent" >All too often, it&#8217;s easy for someone looking at an RPG to be intimidated. So many concepts to grasp, so many ideas
that seem overwhelming. Just as described under What is a Roleplaying Game?, however, how often have you read a
book or watched that movie and decided that you would have done it better? That&#8217;s your imagination at work. Just
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
dive in and you&#8217;ll be amazed at how quickly you can immerse yourself in the Eclipse Phase universe. Soon you&#8217;ll be
spinning stories with the best of them.
<!--l. 142--><p class="indent" >   Also, don&#8217;t forget to tap your resources. Your gaming group is your best resource. What&#8217;s going on, ideas for how
to handle a situation, or how to take on a bad guy: these are just some of the things that can and should be
discussed by the gaming group in between sessions, and each is an opportunity to strengthen your
imagination.
<!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >   Another resource is simply watching TV or reading a good book. Pay attention to how the story is put together,
how the characters are built, and how the plot unfolds. Push your imagination and soon you&#8217;ll be figuring out
subplots and who the bad guy is long before it&#8217;s revealed. Knowing how a story is put together enables you to put
together your own stories during each gaming session.
<!--l. 146--><p class="indent" >   Finally, eclipsephase.com is the offi cial site for Eclipse Phase. If you have questions about the game or want to
see how another group of players handles a given situation, post on the forums. The online community can be just as
helpful and enjoyable as a local gaming group.

 id="x4-280002.1.5"></a>What do players do?</h4>
<!--l. 152--><p class="noindent" >The players can take on a variety of roles in Eclipse Phase. Due to advances in digital mind emulation technology,
uploading, and downloading into new morphs (physical bodies, biological or synthetic), it is possible to literally be a
new person from session to session. With bodies taking on the role of gear, players can customize their forms for the
task at hand.
<!--l. 155--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x4-290002.1.5"></a>The default campaign</h5>
<!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >In the default story (also known as &#8220;campaign setting&#8221;), every player character is a &#8220;sentinel,&#8221; an agent-on-call (or
potential recruit) for a shadowy network known as &#8220;Firewall.&#8221; Firewall is dedicated to counteracting &#8220;existential
risks&#8221;&#8212;threats to the existence of transhumanity. These risks can and do include biowar plagues, nanotech swarm
outbreaks, nuclear proliferation, terrorists with WMDs, netbreaking computer attacks, rogue AIs, alien
encounters, and so on. Firewall isn&#8217;t content to simply counteract these threats as they arise, of course, so
characters may also be sent on information- gathering missions or to put in place pre-emptive or failsafe
measures. Characters may be tasked to investigate seemingly innocuous people and places (who turn out
not to be), make deals with shady criminal networks (who turn out not to be trustworthy), or travel
through a Pandora&#8217;s Gate wormhole to analyze the relics of some alien ruin (and see if the threat
that killed them is still real). Sentinels are recruited from every faction of transhumanity; those who
aren&#8217;t ideologically loyal to the cause are hired as mercenaries. These campaigns tend to mix a bit of
mystery and investigation with fierce bouts of action and combat, also stirring in a nice dose of awe and
horror.
<!--l. 161--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x4-300002.1.5"></a>Alternate campaigns</h5>
<!--l. 164--><p class="noindent" >When they&#8217;re not saving the solar system, sentinels are free to pursue their own endeavors. The gamemaster and
players can use this rulebook to generate any type of story they wish to tell. However, the following examples
provide a brief look at the most obvious opportunities for adventure in Eclipse Phase.
<!--l. 166--><p class="indent" >   After each campaign variant below, a list of &#8220;archetypes&#8221; for Eclipse Phase are provided in parenthesis.
Archetypes are the names applied to the most common character types featured in those scenarios. For example, in
a traditional detective story, the archetypes would be the Detective, the Damsel In Distress, the Hard-bitten Cop,
and so on. In a cowboy movie, the archetypes would be the Gunfighter, the Bartender, the Marshal, the Indian
Brave, and so on. Players will note that some archetypes fit into multiple story settings. The character creation
system (p. 128) allows players to create any of the suggested archetypes. Just as roleplaying games are designed for
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
players to build their own stories, however, these archetypes are just suggestions and players can mix and match
how they will.

   The Fall left two worlds and numerous habitats in ruins&#8212;but these devastated cities and stations contain untold
riches for those who are brave and foolhardy enough. Potential hauls include: weapon systems; physical resources;
lost databanks; left-behind uploads of friends, family, or important people; new technologies developed and lost
in the brief singularity takeoff; valued heirlooms of immortal oligarchs; and much more. Outside of
these once-inhabited realms, space itself is a big place and lots of people and things get lost out there.
Some need to be saved and some are beyond saving. This option lets players explore the unknown or
seek out specific targets on contract. (Archeologist/Scavenger/Pirate/Free Trader/ Smuggler/Black

class="cmbx-10">Exploration:</span></span>
   There are plenty of opportunities to be had as an explorer, colonist, or long-range scout&#8212;perhaps even as one of
the few lucky or suicidal individuals who explore through an untested Pandora&#8217;s Gate. Even the Kuiper Belt, on the
fringe of our solar system, is still sparsely explored; there may be riches and mysteries still to be found. Many
dangers also lurk in odd corners of the system, from isolationist posthuman factions to secretive criminal cartels, as
well as pirates, aliens, and others wishing to remain out of sight. (Explorer/Archeologist/ Scavenger/Singularity

<!--l. 172--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a

class="cmbx-10">Trade:</span></span>
   While the majority of inner system trade is controlled by sleek hypercorporations, many of the smaller or
more independent stations rely on small traders. In the post-scarcity outer system, trade takes on
a different form, with information, favors, and creativity serving as currency among those who no
longer want for anything due to the availability of cornucopia machines. (Free Trader/Smuggler/Black

<!--l. 174--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x4-340002.1.5"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Crime:</span></span>
   The patchwork of city-state habitats and widely varying laws throughout the system create ample opportunity
for those who would make a living from this situation. Black market commodities and activities include
infomorph-slave trading, pleasure pod sex industries, data brokerage and theft, extracting/smuggling advanced
technologies and scientists, political/economic espionage, assassination, drug and XP dealing, soul-trading, and
much more. Whether as an independent or part of an organized criminal element, there are always opportunities for
those with a thirst for adventure or profit and questionable morals. (Criminal/Smuggler/ Pirate/Fixer/Black

   The constant maneuvering of ideologically-driven factions, the squabbling over contested resources, and the
rush to colonize new exoplanets beyond the Pandora Gates all spark new conflicts on a regular basis.
Some of these simmer and seeth as low-intensity conflicts for years, occasionally flaring into raids
and clashes. Others break out into all-out warfare. Women and men willing to bear arms for credits
are always in demand for good wages. Players can engage in commando and military campaigns in
habitats, between the stars, or in hostile planetary environments. (Merc/Security Specialist/Fixer/Bounty

class="cmbx-10">Socio-Political Intrigue:</span></span>
   The corporations and political factions that span the solar system do not always play nice with each other, but
neither is it wise for them to openly confront each other except under extreme circumstances. Many battles are
fought with diplomacy and political maneuvering, using words and ideas more potent than weapons. Even
within factions, social cliques can compete ruthlessly, or heated class confl icts can come to a boil,
tearing a society apart from within. In this campaign, the players can start as pawns of some entity
who rise through the ranks as they become more enmeshed in the intrigues of their sponsor, play a
group of ambassadors and spies stationed in the opposition&#8217;s capital, or can play a group of activists
and radicals fighting for social change. (Politico/ Socialite/Covert Ops/Hacker/Security Specialist/

<!--l. 184--><p class="noindent" >While Eclipse Phase is set in the not-too-distant future, the changes that have taken place due to the advancements
of technology have transformed the Earth and its inhabitants almost beyond recognition. As players dive into the
universe, they&#8217;ll generally encounter one of the following settings.
<!--l. 187--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x4-380002.1.6"></a>Humanity&#8217;s habitats</h5>
<!--l. 190--><p class="noindent" >The Earth has been left an ecologically-devastated ruin, but humanity has taken to the stars. When
Earth was abandoned, so too were the last of the great nation-states; transhumanity now lacks a single
unifying governing body and is instead subject to the laws and regulations of whomever controls a given
habitat.
<!--l. 192--><p class="indent" >   The majority of transhumanity is confined to orbital habitats or satellite stations scattered throughout the Sol
system. Some of these were constructed from scratch in the orbit or Lagrange points of planetary bodies, others
have been hewn out of solid satellites and large asteroids. These stations have myriad purposes from trade to
warfare, espionage to research.
<!--l. 194--><p class="indent" >   Mars continues to be one of transhumanity&#8217;s largest settlements, though it too, suffered heavily during the Fall.
Numerous cities and settlements remain, however, though the planet is only partially terraformed. Venus, Luna, and
Titan are also home to significant populations. Additionally, there are a small number of colonies that have been
established on exoplanets (on the other side of the Pandora Gates) with environments that are not too hostile
towards humanity.
<!--l. 196--><p class="indent" >   Some transhumans prefer to live on large colony ships or linked swarms of smaller spacecraft, moving
nomadically. Some of these rovers intentionally exile themselves to the far limits of the solar system, far from
everyone else, while others actively trade from habitat to habitat, station to station, serving as mobile black
markets.
<!--l. 199--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x4-390002.1.6"></a>The great unknown</h5>
<!--l. 202--><p class="noindent" >The areas of the galaxy that have felt the touch of humanity are few and far between. Lying betwixt these
occasional outposts of questionable civilization are mysteries both dangerous and wonderful. Ever since the
discovery of the Pandora Gates, there has been no shortage of adventurers brave or foolhardy enough to strike out
on their own into the unknown regions of space in hopes of finding more alien artifacts, or even establishing contact
with one of the other sentient races in the universe.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x4-400002.1.6"></a>The mesh</h5>
<!--l. 208--><p class="noindent" >While not a &#8220;setting&#8221; in the traditional sense, as the sections describe above, the computer networks known as the
&#8220;mesh&#8221; are all-pervasive. This ubiquitous computing environment is made possible thanks to advanced
computer technologies and nanofabrication that allow unlimited data storage and near-instantaneous
transmission capacities. With micro-scale, cheap-to-produce wireless transceivers so abundant, literally
everything is wirelessly connected and online. Via implants or small personal computers, characters have
access to archives of information that dwarf the entire 21st-century internet and sensor systems that
pervade every public place. People&#8217;s entire lives are recorded and lifelogged, shared with others on one of
numerous social networks that link everyone together in a web of contacts, favors, and reputation
systems.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1.7   </span> <a 
 id="x4-410002.1.7"></a>Ego vs. Morph</h4>
<!--l. 214--><p class="noindent" >The distinction between ego (your mind and personality, including memories, knowledge, and skills) and morph
(your physical body and its capabilities) is one of the defi ning characteristics of Eclipse Phase. A good
understanding of the concept right up front will allow players a glimpse at all the story possibilities out of the
gate.
<!--l. 216--><p class="indent" >   Your body is disposable. If it gets old, sick, or too heavily damaged, you can digitize your consciousness and
download it into a new one. The process isn&#8217;t cheap or easy, but it does guarantee you effective immortality&#8212;as long
as you remember to back yourself up and don&#8217;t go insane. The term morph is used to describe any type of form your
mind inhabits, whether a vat-grown clone sleeve, a synthetic robotic shell, a part-bio/part-synthetic &#8220;pod,&#8221; or even
the purely electronic software state of an infomorph.
<!--l. 218--><p class="indent" >   A character&#8217;s morph may die, but the character&#8217;s ego may live on, assuming appropriate backup measures have
been taken. Morphs are expendable, but your character&#8217;s ego represents the ongoing, continuous life path of your
character&#8217;s mind and personality. This continuity may be interrupted by an unexpected death (depending on
how recently the backup was made), but it represents the totality of the character&#8217;s mental state and
experiences.
<!--l. 220--><p class="indent" >   Some aspects of your character&#8212;particularly skills, along with some stats and traits&#8212;belong to
your character&#8217;s ego and so stay with them throughout the character&#8217;s development. Some stats and
traits, however, are determined by morph, as noted, and so will change if your character leaves one
body and takes on another. Morphs may also affect other skills and stats, as detailed in the morph
description.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1.8   </span> <a 
 id="x4-420002.1.8"></a>Where to go from here?</h4>
<!--l. 226--><p class="noindent" >Now that you know what this game is about, we suggest that you next read the Time of Eclipse chapter (p. 30), to
get a feel for the game&#8217;s default setting (which you are, of course, free to change to suit your whims). Then read the
Game Mechanics chapter (p. 112) to get a grasp of the rules. After that, you can move on to Character Creation and
Advancement (p. 128) and create your first character!
<!--l. 229--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1.9   </span> <a 
 id="x4-430002.1.9"></a>Terminology</h4>
<!--l. 232--><p class="noindent" >Eclipse Phase uses a host of jargon to simply convey the numerous concepts covered within the pages of this book.
While not all-inclusive, this list of terminology will allow players to quickly acclimate themselves for their journey
into Eclipse Phase. If you read something and are confused, don&#8217;t worry. These concepts are fully explained in later
sections of this book.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 234--><p class="indent" >   Note that several of the words on this list are standard scientific terms, often used in astronomy. As Eclipse
Phase attempts to remain as close to &#8220;hard science&#8221; as possible&#8212;while allowing players to interact with the great
stories waiting to unfold&#8212;such terms are used liberally.

     <!--l. 396--><p class="indent" >    Greetings,
     <!--l. 398--><p class="indent" >    Your references and background have been triple-checked and confirmed, and you are now
     vetted as a sentinel operative. Welcome to Firewall, friend.
     <!--l. 400--><p class="indent" >    For those new to our private network, Firewall is an organization dedicated to protecting
     transhumanity from threats&#8212;both internal and external&#8212;to our continued existence as a species.
     The  Fall  may  have  reminded  us  that  our  ability  to  survive  and  prosper  is  not  guaranteed,
     but  our  kind  has  a  remarkably  short  attention  span.  Despite  our  achievement  of  functional
     near-immortality, we continue to face numerous dangers that may contribute to our extinction.
     Some of these risks come from our own factionalism and divisiveness, combined with universally
     available technology that could cause widespread destruction and untold deaths in the wrong
     hands.  Some  stem  from  our  short-sightedness,  failing  to  see  the  dangers  in  which  we  place
     ourselves and our environments through careless actions. Some arise from our own creations
     turned against us, as the TITANs proved. Other risks may come from alien intelligences whose
     motivations we cannot yet fathom, and of whom we may not even be aware. Still others may
     threaten us by sheer chance and the mindless but deadly cause-and-effect of a universe in which
     we are but an insignificant speck.
     <!--l. 402--><p class="indent" >    Firewall exists to identify, analyze, and counter these risks. We are all volunteers. We are all
     placing our own lives at risk in order to ensure the survival of transhumanity.
     <!--l. 404--><p class="indent" >    Firewall has existed, under other names and guises, since before the Fall. Numerous agencies
     with a similar agenda banded together in the wake of those cataclysmic events to assess our
     situation and prepare for the worst. Now we operate under a single umbrella.
     <!--l. 406--><p class="indent" >    We are a private network for two reasons. First, our existence and operational abilities are
     protected by our secrecy. The less our opposition knows about us, the more effectively we can
     counter them. Similarly, certain authorities might be hostile to an organization such as ours
     operating in their claimed territory. Though some may be aware of our existence, we bypass
     numerous legal and jurisdictional hurdles that might otherwise hamper our actions and goals.
     Second, our mission sometimes brings to light information that is not only dangerous in the wrong
     hands, but might even trigger widespread panic if made public. In some cases, the very existence
     of such knowledge could be problematic. By retaining secrecy and operating on a need-to-know
     basis, we automatically counter certain risks.

     <!--l. 430--><p class="indent" >    Forget all of that AI-generated intro crap you just read. Here&#8217;s the real deal.
     <!--l. 432--><p class="indent" >    You&#8217;re probably dying to know what you&#8217;ve been dragged into. Maybe you&#8217;ve been told the
     party line already: that we&#8217;re all that stands between transhumanity and extinction. Or maybe
     someone whispered to you that we&#8217;re a rogue operation that meddles in heavy shit that we have
     no authority to get involved in, and that we sometimes get people killed as a result. You must be
     curious. Maybe you&#8217;ve got a vigilante streak, and you&#8217;re looking to spill blood for a good cause.
     Would it matter to you if the cause was a deluded one? Maybe you&#8217;re a conspiracy wingnut
     and you&#8217;re dying to know what secrets Firewall is clutching to its collective chest. What if those
     secrets shattered the carefully constructed lies that we all tell to ourselves to keep our sanity
     intact?
     <!--l. 434--><p class="indent" >    Everything you&#8217;ve heard, good or bad, about Firewall very well may be true. We&#8217;re not angels.
     We lost the sheen on our ideals when the TITANs forcibly uploaded their first human mind.
     Right now, you should be asking yourself what the fuck you just signed up for. I did.
     <!--l. 436--><p class="indent" >    Truth is, Firewall is lots of things. Most of it is good, but a lot of it so fucking horrible you&#8217;ll
     be thinking about planting a bullet in your stack and resorting to an earlier backup, just so
     you can forget it all. If you have any romantic visions about being a hero, though, drop them
     now. You won&#8217;t feel like a hero when you airlock some kid because he&#8217;s carrying an infectious
     nanovirus. You won&#8217;t feel brave when you run across some alien thing and crap your pants. And
     you won&#8217;t even feel human anymore when you make a call that will cost dozens, hundreds, or
     even thousands of people their lives, even if you are saving millions more.
     <!--l. 438--><p class="indent" >    So why would anyone be crazy enough to be part of this thing? Because it needs to be done.
     Our survival depends on it. To some people, it&#8217;s altruism, defending transhumanity. But really,
     it&#8217;s about saving your own fucking neck too. Sure, you could abstain from taking responsibility
     and let some self- described authority take care of it. But if the anarchists have anything right,
     it&#8217;s that people in power can&#8217;t be trusted. As often as not, they&#8217;re part of the problem. So
     Firewall does things the collective way. We&#8217;re underground, but we&#8217;re an open source operation.
     We share information and resources towards a common goal. We organize in networked ad-hoc
     cells, smart-mob style. We don&#8217;t let anyone accrue too much power or control. Everyone involved
     in an op has an equal say. We police ourselves. We come from all sorts of backgrounds and
     factions, but we face a common enemy&#8212;and we fight to win. There is no alternative.
     <!--l. 440--><p class="indent" >    Maybe you&#8217;ve heard of the Fermi Paradox? That question asked why, with a galaxy so huge,
     there were so few signs of other life? Even though we&#8217;ve met the Factors and seen evidence of
     other aliens, our galactic neighborhood should be crawling with intelligence&#8212;but it&#8217;s not.
     <!--l. 442--><p class="indent" >    I&#8217;ll tell you why. The universe is not fucking fair. If transhumanity were wiped out, the galaxy
     wouldn&#8217;t even notice. Just look at the Earth. That planet still exists, still supports life, even
     though we&#8217;re far gone. Reality is an uncaring asshole. Forget all that utopian crap about living
     forever. We&#8217;ll be lucky to survive another year. We&#8217;ve developed technologies that put weapons of
     mass destruction in the hands of everyone, but we&#8217;re still an adolescent species that has trouble
     overcoming petty tribal bullshit. If you&#8217;re really looking forward to exploring the universe as a
     postmortal, you&#8217;re going to have to work hard at it. Survival isn&#8217;t a right, it&#8217;s a privilege.
     <!--l. 444--><p class="indent" >    When you sign up with Firewall, you put yourself on call. Anytime some shit goes down in
     your neck of the woods or that you might be particularly helpful in dealing with, you&#8217;ll get a call.
     You&#8217;ll be expected to drop whatever you&#8217;re doing and put everything else on hold as if your life
     depended on it&#8212;it probably does. When you&#8217;re in the field, on an op&#8212; &#8221;going to the doctor,&#8221; as
     we call it&#8212;your cell is empowered to act as it sees fit ... just keep in mind that you&#8217;ll be answering
     to the rest of us later. You&#8217;ll also have the Firewall network to back you up&#8212;though resources
     are often limited, so don&#8217;t expect us to always save your ass. Other sentinels can be called on to
     pull strings, but every time we do so, it threatens to unveil an agent, create a trail that we need
     to clean up, and otherwise complicates matters. Self-reliance is key.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     <!--l. 446--><p class="indent" >    One last thing: don&#8217;t ever, ever forget that we have enemies. I&#8217;m not just talking about the
     nutjob who wants to nuke a habitat to make a political statement or the neo-luddites who think
     biowar plagues will teach us all a lesson, I&#8217;m talking about the agencies that know Firewall exists
     and consider it a threat. If they tag you as a sentinel, your days are numbered. Maybe your
     backups too. So watch yer friggin&#8217; back.
     <!--l. 448--><p class="indent" >    So that&#8217;s the real deal, as honest as I can give it. Welcome to our secret clubhouse, comrade.
     Remember: death is just another day on the job.
