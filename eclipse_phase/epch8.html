class="cmmi-10">&#x22B3; </span>Desdemona: Glad to have you back. I hope you had a pleasant farcast from Pelion and
     don&#8217;t feel too much lack. While you were out, a message from Aeneas with a precis on psi,
     extracted from the infomorph backup of psigeneticist Daborva (StellInt, Dipole Research Station
     on Ganymede), was rerouted for distribution to your Firewall node.</div>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >Coined by the biologist Bertold P. Wiesner, &#8220;psi&#8221; was originally an umbrella term used to describe a number of
so-called &#8220;psychic&#8221; abilities and other speculative paranormal phenomena such as telepathy and extra-sensory
perception. While the term was used extensively in the field of parapsychology and pop culture in the twentieth and
early twenty-first centuries, the study of psi was largely considered a pseudoscience with flawed methodologies
and gradually lost funding and support. During the Fall, however, repeated rumors and accounts of
unexplained phenomenon drew the attention of scientists, military leaders, and singularity seekers
alike. Numerous nanovirii had been unleashed upon transhumanity, racing through populations and
transforming as they spread. Some inflicted only minor biological or mental changes and impairments,
but many were vicious and deadly. The most feared variants, however, were those that Firewall has
come to label as the Exsurgent virus&#8212;a transformative nano-plague that mutates its victims and
subverts them to its will. The Exsurgent virus was also observed to radically modify the subject&#8217;s neural
patterns and mental state, affecting synaptic arrangement and even modulating synaptic currents.
These changes alter and enhance the victim&#8217;s cognition and seemed to endow an ability to sense and
even affect the minds of others from a short distance&#8212;an ability dubbed &#8220;psi&#8221; as the causal factors
continue to mystify us. The existence and nature of this phenomenon remains carefully concealed
and under wraps in controlled habitats, so as not to trigger widespread panic. Among anarchist and
other open communities, knowledge of psi is more widespread, but details are vague and reports are
generally greeted with skepticism. The Exsurgent virus is exceptionally mutable and adaptive, however,
and two argonaut researchers who were aware of and studying it soon made an interesting discovery.
One variant strain of the virus was found that endowed the subject with exceptional mental abilities
without engaging the transformative process of the other strains. Though infection still has other
drawbacks, Firewall and other agencies have come to regard this strain as &#8220;safe&#8221; in the sense that
the subject does not transmogrify into something else and their general personality remains intact.
Intrigued that this avenue of inquiry might lead to a way to nullify the effects of other Exsurgent
strains, Firewall and others continue to experiment with the strain with the cooperation of willing
test subjects (or according to some reports, unwilling victims in the case of certain authorities and
hypercorps).

 id="x10-8110008.1.1"></a>THE NATURE OF PSI</h4>
<!--l. 94--><p class="noindent" >Labeled the Watts-MacLeod strain after the researchers who isolated it, further study has gained insight into the
effect this virus has on transhuman brains. Careful analysis of infected subjects discovered that their altered
synapses generate a modulated brainwave pattern that is extremely difficult to detect. Those &#8220;in-the-know&#8221; have
come to refer to these asynchronous brainwaves as &#8220;psi waves,&#8221; fitting with the Greek letter designation of other
brainwaves (alpha, beta, delta, gamma, theta). Likewise, affected individuals are known as &#8220;asyncs.&#8221; Exploration of
the explicit causal factors behind psi waves remains stymied. Theories regarding extraordinary mental processes
with the ability to change quantum states have been explored but remain frustratingly inconclusive.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
Neuroimaging and mapping have enabled scientists to pinpoint structures within the brain, neural activity, and
perturbations in the brain&#8217;s bioelectric field that are associated with psi processes, but attempts to duplicate
these features in non-infected brains have resulted in failure or worse. Attempts to identify asyncs by
psi brainwave patterns are not even assured of success. Numerous dead ends have prompted many
researchers to postulate that the mechanics underlying psi are simply too strange and too far beyond
transhumanity&#8217;s understanding of physical sciences&#8212;perhaps reinforcing theories that the Exsurgent virus is in
fact of alien origin. One leading speculation is that the changes wrought in the mind by infection
actually entangle some of the neural sub-systems, enable some sort of quantum field within the brain, or
possibly create Bose-Einstein condensates within the brain, allowing for quantum computation or
perhaps hypercomputation. This enhances the async&#8217;s mental capabilities to the level provided by
modern implants and neuro-mods&#8212;and sometimes beyond. This does not explain the capabilities of
other asyncs, however, especially those used to read or affect other biological minds. These abilities
seem to involve reading brain waves from a short range or affecting another&#8217;s mind via direct physical
contact with the target&#8217;s bio-electric fields. Of course I can only speculate in accordance with what
Firewall has uncovered&#8212;it is quite possible that certain hypercorps or other factions have made further
breakthroughs, but are keeping the information to themselves. The initiation and use of psi talents is generally
understood to take place on a subconscious level, meaning that the async is not actively aware of the
fundamental processes that fuel the psi-waves. Training in certain skills, however, allows an async to focus on
certain tasks and psi abilities. These are called &#8220;sleights:&#8221; mnemonic or cognitive algorithms of psi use
rooted in the async&#8217;s ego. The percentage of the transhuman population believed to have contracted
the Watts-MacLeod strain remains statistically insignificant&#8212;less than .001% of the population. The
vast number of asyncs have been recruited by various agencies, &#8220;disappeared&#8221; for study, or simply
eliminated as a potential threat. Ten years after the Fall, Firewall and other agencies have come to regard
Watts-MacLeod infection as comparatively safe, though we remain quite wary of unforeseen side effects or
other hidden dangers. Most of us engaged in studying the phenomenon now consider asyncs to be
useful as a tool for fighting the Exsurgent virus and other threatsdespite the protests of those who are
convinced that asyncs are not in control of their own minds and are not to be trusted. As of yet we
have encountered no cases of Watts-MacLeod infection that have inflicted anything other than psi
abilities, though there seems to be an increased risk for asyncs to succumb to other Exsurgent strains
should they encounter them. There are other risks associated with Watts-MacLeod infection, such as
extreme fatigue and even lethal biofeedback resulting from extensive use of psi sleights and a statistically
likelihood of developing mental disorders due to the increased mental stress placed on the async&#8217;s
mind.

class="cmbxti-10">1 </span>Sorry to bother you, but my muse just alerted me to this excerpt that was sent around to my Firewall team. Is
this for real? I&#8217;ve heard the talk about psi before&#8212;enough to be convinced that there&#8217;s something to it, even if we
can&#8217;t explain it&#8212;but this bit about variant Exsurgent infection is too much. Are we seriously going to be working
with someone who&#8217;s a known carrier? And can you shed any more light on how asyncs do their mojo?
I&#8217;m worried now. And since you are connected to the Medeans, I thought I&#8217;d take the chance and
ask.
<!--l. 222--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbxti-10">2 </span>Well, as to the Medeans ... that&#8217;s history. I am back on the freelancing market right now. But no problem, I&#8217;ll
try and explain. I know it is not easy to grasp.

<!--l. 229--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbxti-10">2 </span>Yes, Srit was once infected with a strain of the Exsurgent virus, probably on Mars near the
end of the Fall. I say &#8220;was&#8221; because the Watts-MacLeod strain seems to go dormant shortly after it
finishes rewiring the victim&#8217;s brain; the plague nanobots die off and get flushed out of the system,
unlike other Exsurgent strains, which continue to stick around and transform the subject. At least,
that&#8217;s the dominant theory&#8212;I&#8217;ve also seen some speculation that async minds might be modified so
that they continue to produce bio-nanobots that linger in the brain, though what function these serve
remains unclear. However, the prevailing opinion among our best neuroscientists is that people like Srit
are safe and non-infectious once the virus has run its course. I&#8217;ll even go a bit further and say that
prevailing opinion is that they can be trusted, assuming they don&#8217;t catch another infection ... which they
unfortunately seem to be a bit prone too. Not everyone agrees of course, but we have an abundance of
paranoia in our circles. So far, we haven&#8217;t seen any evidence that any of our asyncs have been turned by
that initial infection, and the utility and usefulness of having psiactives on our side has simply been
too important to push aside. All right. I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ll trust her, but I&#8217;ll try and give her the
benefit of the doubt. I&#8217;ll be damned if I&#8217;m going to trust an async that&#8217;s not vouched for by Firewall
though&#8212;who knows what the hell a hypercorp like Skinthetic might be cooking up in their black
labs.
<!--l. 272--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbxti-10">2 </span>That seems like a wise choice.
<!--l. 274--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbxti-10">1 </span>Maybe you can put my mind at ease by explaining to me in a bit more detail how Watts-MacLeod infection
occurs.
<!--l. 279--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbxti-10">2 </span>Well, like the other Exsurgent strains you are unfortunately familiar with, the primary transmission vector is a
nanovirus, but we speculate that it may also be transmitted as a digital computer virus or possibly even as a basilisk
hack. The physical plague form is spread by highly-advanced techno-organic nanobots that infect a biomorph and
use bio-mimicry mechanisms to pass as normal cells and penetrate the blood-brain barrier and central
nervous system. The nanobots are several steps beyond anything our technology can produce, are very
difficult to detect, and can overwhelm most defensive countermeasures. Infected minds are essentially
rewired, and these changes will be copied when the ego is uploaded. Synthmorphs and infomorphs
remain immune to this nano-infection, but they are theoretically vulnerable to other transmission
vectors.
<!--l. 304--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbxti-10">1 </span>I&#8217;ve heard that synthmorphs are effectively invulnerable to psi as well. This true?
<!--l. 308--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbxti-10">2 </span>Yes. As far as we can tell, async abilities only effect biological minds&#8212;either their own or others. And they
can only read/affect others from a very short distance, requiring physical contact in most cases. The
half-biological minds of pods are also vulnerable, though to a lesser extent. Likewise, asyncs need a biological
brain to use their abilities&#8212;they can&#8217;t use their psi if sleeved in a synthmorph and have difficulty in a
pod.
<!--l. 321--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbxti-10">1 </span>Interesting. So, I have to ask again&#8212; you&#8217;re sure she&#8217;s safe? I&#8217;ve heard that some of these asyncs can be real
nut-jobs.
<!--l. 326--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbxti-10">2 </span>I&#8217;ve heard from several of these asyncs directly. The fact is, infection rewrites their brain, and some of them
came out the other side feeling fundamentally altered. Either they felt like a different person, or they felt like there
was something new that was part of them&#8212;something that they didn&#8217;t necessarily like. One described it as
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
presence, another as a black void that whispered at them. Yet another described it as giving a personality to their
unconscious mind, which only made the gulf between unconscious and conscious mind all the more intimidating.
Some of them preferred to suicide and revert to a pre-infection backup. While they may be more prone to
cracking up as a result, I haven&#8217;t ever heard one talk about their abilities as something they couldn&#8217;t
control.
<!--l. 349--><p class="indent" >   1 Well, that&#8217;s fucking cheery. There&#8217;s nothing else we have on how this psi stuff actually works?
<!--l. 353--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbxti-10">2 </span>Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t. Even the Prometheans haven&#8217;t been much help. There are theories, of course, but
nothing that we&#8217;ve been able to verify with rigorous experimentation. It doesn&#8217;t help that the factions that
are aware of psi&#8217;s existence don&#8217;t exactly compare notes&#8212;they&#8217;re all too busy looking into ways to
weaponize it and use it against each other, instead of figuring out how to use it for the benefit of
transhumanity.
<!--l. 366--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbxti-10">1 </span>Of course. The TITANs didn&#8217;t get us, but we can still get ourselves. It worries me that the best we&#8217;ve come up
with is nothing.
<!--l. 371--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbxti-10">2 </span>It&#8217;s important to keep perspective. Transhumanity has come quite a distance and made some impressive
accomplishments, but our understanding of the universe is still in its infancy. What we may be facing here is
something concocted by an intelligence so far beyond our own that we are but insignificant insects in comparison. It
likely has a grasp on the universe that is simply beyond our ability to understand. We shouldn&#8217;t be
cocky and think that we can decipher any mystery thrown at us ... we should instead be very, very
afraid.
<!--l. 387--><p class="indent" >
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 389--><p class="indent" >   Though neuroscience has ascended to impressive pinnacles, allowing minds to be thoroughly scanned,
mapped, and emulated as software, the transhuman brain remains a place that is complicated, not fully
understood, and thoroughly messy. Despite a prevalence of neural modifications, meddling with the seat of
consciousness remains a tricky and hazardous procedure. Nevertheless, psychosurgery&#8212;editing the mind as
software&#8212;remains common and widespread, sometimes with unexpected results. Likewise, even as the
knowledge of neuroscientists grows on an exponential basis, some are discovering that minds are far more
mysterious than they had ever imagined. During the Fall, scattered reports of &#8220;anomalous activity&#8221;
by individuals infected by one of the numerous circulating nanoplagues were discounted as fear and
paranoia, but subsequent investigations by black budget labs has proven otherwise. Now, toplevel
confidential networks whisper that this infection inflicts intricate changes in the victim&#8217;s neural network
that imbue them with strange and inexplicable abilities. The exact mechanism and nature of these
abilities remains unexplained and outside the grasp of modern transhuman science. Given the evidence
of a new brainwave type and the paranormal nature of this phenomenon, it is loosely referred to as
&#8220;psi.&#8221;

<!--l. 417--><p class="noindent" >In Eclipse Phase, psi is considered a special cognitive condition resulting from infection by the mutant&#8212;and
hopefully otherwise benign&#8212;Watts-Macleod strain of the Exsurgent virus (p. 367). This plague modifies the victim&#8217;s
mind, conferring special abilities. These abilities are inherent to the brain&#8217;s architecture and are copied when the
mind is uploaded, allowing the character to retain their psi abilities when changing from morph to
morph.

<!--l. 429--><p class="noindent" >To wield psi, a character must acquire the Psi trait (p. 147) during character creation. It is theoretically also
possible to acquire the use of psi in game via infection by the Watts-MacLeod strain; see The Exsurgent Virus, p.
362. Psi ability is considered an innate ability of the ego and not a biological or genetic predisposition of the morph.
While psi researchers do not understand how it is possible to transfer this ability via uploads, backups, and
farcasting, it has been speculated that all components of an async&#8217;s ego are entangled on a quantum level, or that
they possess the ability to entangle themselves or form a unique conformation or alignment as a whole
even after they have been copied, up-, or downloaded. This speculated entanglement process is also
thought to be the origin of the impairment that asyncs experience when adapting to a new morph (see
below).

<!--l. 450--><p class="noindent" >Asyncs require a biological brain to draw on their abilities (the brains of uplifted animals count). An async
whose ego is downloaded into an infomorph or fully computerized brain (synthmorphs) has no access to
their abilities as long they remain in that morph. Asyncs inhabiting a pod morph may use psi, but
their abilities are restricted as pod brains are only partly biological. Pod-morphed asyncs suffer a &#8211;30
modifier on all tests involving the use of psi sleights and the impact from using sleights would be
doubled.

<!--l. 492--><p class="noindent" >There are several drawbacks to psi ability:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The variant Exsurgent strain that endows psi ability rewires the character&#8217;s brain. An unfortunate side
     effect to this change is that asyncs acquire a vulnerability to mental stress. Reduce the async&#8217;s Trauma
     Threshold by 1.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The mental instability that accompanies psi infection also tends to unhinge the character&#8217;s mind.
     Asyncs acquires one Mental Disorder negative trait (p. 150) for each level they have of the Psi trait
     without receiving any bonus CP. The gamemaster and player should agree on a disorder appropriate to
     the character. This disorder may be treated over time, according to normal rules (see Mental Healing
     and Psychotherapy, p. 215).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Characters with the Psi trait are also vulnerable to infection by other strains of the Exsurgent virus.
     The character suffers a &#8211;20 modifier when resisting Exsurgent infection (p. 362).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Critical failures when using psi tend to stress the async&#8217;s mind. Each time a critical failure is rolled
     when making a sleight-related test, the async suffers a temporary brain seizure. They suffer a &#8211;30
     modifi er and are incapable of acting until the end of the next Action Turn. They must also succeed
     in a WIL + COG Test or fall down.</li></ul>

 id="x10-8190008.2"></a>PSI SKILLS AND SLEIGHTS</h5>
<!--l. 524--><p class="noindent" >Transhuman psi users can manipulate their egos and otherwise create effects that can often be neither matched nor
mimicked by technological means. To use these abilities, they train their mental processes and practice cognitive
algorithms called sleights, which they can subconsciously recall and use as necessary. Sleights fall into two
categories: psi-chi (cognitive enhancements, p. 223) and psi-gamma (brainwave reading and manipulation, p. 225).
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
Psi-chi sleights are available to anyone with the Psi trait (p. 147), but psigamma sleights are only
available to characters with the Psi trait at Level 2. In order to use these sleights, the async must be
skilled in the Control (p. 178), Psi Assault (p. 183), and/or Sense skills (p. 184), as appropriate to each
sleight.
<!--l. 540--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x10-8200008.2"></a>ROLEPLAYING ASYNCS</h5>
<!--l. 542--><p class="noindent" >Any player who chooses to play an async should keep the origin of their abilities in mind: Watts-MacLeod strain
infection. The character may not be aware of this source, but they undoubtedly know that they underwent
some sort of transformation and have talents that no one else does. If unaware of the infection, they
have likely learned to keep their abilities secret lest they be ridiculed, attacked, or whisked away to
some secret testing program. Learning the truth about their nature could even be the starting point
of a campaign and/or their introduction to Firewall. If they know the truth, however, the character
must live with the fact that they are the victim of a nanoplague likely spread by the TITANs that
may or may not lead to complications, side effects, or other unexpected revelations in their future.
Gamemasters and players should make an effort to explore the nature of this infection and how the character
perceives it. As noted previously, asyncs are often profoundly-changed people. The invasive and alien
aspect of their abilities should not be lost on them. For example, an async might conceive of their
psi talents as a sort of parasitic entity, living off their sleights, or they might feel that using these
powers puts them in touch with some sort of fundamental substrate of the universe that is weird and
terrifying. Alternately, they could feel as if their personality was melded with something different,
something that doesn&#8217;t belong. Each async is likely to view their situation differently, and none of them
pleasantly.

<!--l. 582--><p class="noindent" >Active psi sleights must be &#8220;activated&#8221; to be used. These sleights usually require a skill test. Sleights that target
other sentient beings or life forms are always Opposed Tests, while others are handled as Success Tests. The level of
concentration required to use these sleights varies, and so may call for a Quick, Complex, or Task
Action. Active sleights also cause strain (p. 223) to the async. Most psi-gamma sleights fall into this
category.
<!--l. 592--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x10-8230008.2.1"></a>PASSIVE PSI</h5>
<!--l. 594--><p class="noindent" >Passive psi sleights encompasses abilities that are considered automatically active and subconscious. They rarely
require an action to be activated and require no effort or strain by the psi user. Passive sleights typically add
bonuses to various activities or allow access to certain abilities rather than calling for some kind of skill test. Most
psi-chi sleights fall into this category.

<!--l. 604--><p class="noindent" >Sleights have a Range of either Self, Touch, or Close. Self: These sleights only affect the async. Touch: Sleights with
a Touch range may be used against other biological life, but the async must have physical contact with
the target. If the target avoids being touched, this requires a successful melee attack, applying the
touch-only +20 modifier. This attack does not cause damage, and is considered part of the same action as
the psi use. Close: Close sleights involve interaction with other biological life from a short distance.
The optimal distance is within 5 meters. For each meter beyond that, apply a &#8211;10 modifier to the
test. Psi vs. Psi: Due to the nature of psi, sleights are more effective against other psi users. Sleights
with a range of Touch may be used from a Close range against another async. Likewise, a sleight
with a Close range may be used at twice the normal distance (10 meters) when wielded on another
async.
<!--l. 624--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x10-8250008.2.1"></a>TARGETING</h5>
<!--l. 626--><p class="noindent" >Synthmorphs, bots, and vehicles may not be targeted by psi sleights, as they lack biological brains. Pods - with
brains that are half biological and half computer - are less susceptible and receive a +30 modifier when defending
against psi use. Note that infomorphs may never be targeted by psi sleights as psi is not effective within the mesh or
simulspace. Multiple Targets: An async may target more than one character with a sleight with the same action, as
long as each of them can be targeted via the rules above. The psi character only rolls once, with each of the
defending characters making their Opposed Tests against that roll. The psi character suffers strain (p. 223) for each
target, however, meaning that using psi on multiple targets can be extremely dangerous. Animals
and Less Complex Life Forms: Psi works against any living creature with a brain and/or nervous
system. Against partially-sentient and partially- uplifted animals, it suffers a &#8211;20 modifier and increases
strain by +1. Against non-sentient animals, it suffers a &#8211;30 modifier and increases strain by +3. It has
no effect on or against less complex life forms like plants, algae, bacteria, etc. Factors and Aliens:
At the gamemaster&#8217;s discretion, psi sleights may not work on alien creatures at all, depending on
their physiology and neurology. If it does work, it is likely to suffer at least a &#8211;20 modifier and +1
strain.

<!--l. 657--><p class="noindent" >Psi that is used against another character is resisted with an Opposed Test. Defending characters resist with WIL x
2. Willing characters may choose not to resist. Unconscious or sleeping characters cannot resist. If the psi-wielding
character succeeds and the defender fails, the sleight affects the target. If the psi user fails, the defender is
unscathed. If both parties succeed in their tests, compare their dice rolls. If the psi user&#8217;s roll is higher, the sleight
bypasses the defender&#8217;s mental block and affects the target; otherwise, the sleight fails to affect the defender&#8217;s
ego.

<!--l. 671--><p class="noindent" >The target of a psi sleight is aware they are being targeted any time they succeed on their half of the Opposed Test
(regardless on whether the async rolls higher or not). Note that awareness does not necessarily mean that
the target understands that psi abilities are being used on them, especially as most people in Eclipse
Phase are unaware of psi&#8217;s existence. Instead, the target is simply likely to understand that some
outside influence is at work, or that something strange is happening. They may suspect that they have
been drugged or are under the influence of some strange technology. Targets who fail their roll remain
unaware.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 695--><p class="noindent" >If the defender rolls a critical success, the character attempting to wield psi is temporarily locked out of the target&#8217;s
mind. The psi user may not target that character with sleights until an appropriate &#8220;reset&#8221; period has passed,
determined by the gamemaster. If the async rolls a critical failure, they suffer temporary incapacitation as their
mind dysfunctions in some harsh and distressing ways (see Psi Drawbacks, p. 221). If a psi user rolls a critical
success against a defender, or the defender rolls a critical failure, double the potency of the sleight&#8217;s effect. In the
case of psi attacks, the DV can be doubled or mental armor can be bypassed. Alternately, when using Psi
Assault (p. 183), the targeted character may be in danger of infection by the Watts-Macleod strain (p.
362).

<!--l. 720--><p class="noindent" >Psi sleights have one of four durations: constant, instant, temporary, or sustained. Constant: Constant sleights are
always &#8220;on.&#8221; Instant: Instant sleights take effect only in the Action Phase in which they are used. Temporary:
Temporary sleights last for a limited duration with no extra effort from the async. The temporary duration is
determined by the async&#8217;s WIL <span 
class="cmsy-10">÷ </span>5 (round up) and is measured in either Action Turns or minutes, as noted.
Strain for the sleight is applied immediately when used, not at the end of the duration. Sustained:
Sustained sleights require active effort to maintain for as long as the async wants to keep it active.
Sustaining a sleight requires concentration, and so the async suffers a &#8211;10 modifier to all other skill tests
while the sleight is sustained. The async must also stay within the range appropriate to the sleight,
otherwise the sleight immediately ends. More than one sleight may be sustained at a time, with a
cumulative modifier. Strain for the sleight is applied immediately when used, not at the end of the
duration. At the gamemaster&#8217;s discretion, sleights that are sustained for long periods may incur additional
strain.
<!--l. 744--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x10-8320008.2.1"></a>STRAIN</h5>
<!--l. 746--><p class="noindent" >The use of psi is physically (and sometimes psychologically) draining to a psi user. This phenomenon is known as
strain, and manifests as fatigue, exhaustion, pain, neural overload, cardiovascular stress, and adynamia (loss of
vigor). Though strain has only rarely been known to actually kill an async, the use of too much active psi can be
life-threatening in some circumstances. In game terms, every active sleight has a Strain Value of 1d10 <span 
class="cmsy-10">÷ </span>2 (round
up) DV. Every active sleight lists a Strain Value Modifier that modifies this amount. For example, a sleights with a
Strain Value Modifier of &#8211;1 inflicts (1d10 <span 
class="cmsy-10">÷ </span>2) &#8211;1 DV. If the damage points suffered from strain exceed

     (25 <span

     a 1, so he takes no strain at all! Later on, Matric finds himself in a life-or-death struggle with
     a kidnapper. Lucky for Matric, they&#8217;re in a melee, so he&#8217;s close enough to try and touch his
     opponent. On his Action Phase, he makes an Unarmed Combat Test with a +20 modifi er (for
     a touch-only attack) and succeeds. This allows him to try and use his Psychic Stab sleight. He
     rolls his Psi Assault of 57 against the target&#8217;s WIL x 2 (32). His target is in a worker pod morph,
     however, which is less susceptible to psi, so he receives a +30 modifier (32 + 30 = 62). Matric
     rolls a 32 and the worker pod a 64&#8212;Matric wins! For damage, he rolls 1d10 + (WIL <span

     WIL is 25, so that&#8217;s 1d10 + 3. He rolls a score a 7 and inflicts 10 (7 + 3) points of damage. The
     worker pod screams in pain, suffering a wound from the psychic assault.

items jump out at them. This is useful for translating languages, breaking codes, or find clues hidden
among massive amounts of data. The character must have a sufficiently large sample enough time to

transhuman language to a few days of investigating inscriptions left by long-dead aliens to a week or
more of researching a lengthy cipher. Languages may be comprehended by reading or listening to
them being spoken. Apply a +20 modifier to any appropriate Language, Investigation, Research, or
cod-breaking Tests (note that this does not apply to Infosec Tests made by software to decrypt a code). The
async may also use this ability to more easily learn new languages, reducing the training time by

their ability to estimate and predict outcomes of events around them as they unfold in real-time and
update those predictions as information changes. In effect, the character has a more intuitive sense for
which outcomes are most likely. This grants the character a +10 bonus on any skill tests that involve
predicting the outcome of events. It also bolsters the async&#8217;s decision-making in combat situations by
making the best course of action more clear, and so provides a +10 bonus to both Initiative and Fray

rubble distribution from an explosion. However, this mathematic facility is largely intuitive, so the character does
not know the equations they are solving, they merely know the solution to the problem. This sleight also
provides a +30 modifier to any skill tests involving math (which the character is calculating, not a

period will be hazy at best. The advantage is that the unconscious mind acts more quickly, and so the
async&#8217;s Speed is boosted by +1. The character remains aware and active, but is incapable of complex
communication or other mental actions and is motivated by instinct and primitive urges more than
conscious thought. Though it is recommended that the player retain control of their character while
using Unconscious Lead, the gamemaster should feel free to direct the character&#8217;s actions as they see
fit.

async to induce, amplify, or tone down specific emotions, thereby manipulating the target. If the async beats the
target in an Opposed Test, they will act in accordance with the emotion for the duration and under certain

within the async&#8217;s range. To detect these life forms, the async makes a single Sense Test, opposed by each life form
within range. The async may suffer a modifier for detecting small animals and insects, similar to the modifier
applied for targeting them in ranged combat (see p. 193); likewise, a modifier for detecting larger life forms may also
be applied. If successful, the async has detected that the life form is nearby. Every 10 full points of MoS will
ascertain another piece of information regarding the detected life: direction from async, approximate size, type of
creature, distance from async, etc. The async will know if the target moves, if they do so during the sleight&#8217;s

The intent is not to fake memories, but to place one of the async&#8217;s memories in the target&#8217;s mind so
that the target can access it just like any other memory. This can be useful for &#8220;archiving&#8221; important
data with an ally, providing a literal alternate perspective, or simply making a &#8220;data dump&#8221; for the

quirks more often. The async must use this sleight on a target and succeed in a Success Test. If successful, the async
acquires an &#8220;imprint&#8221; of the target&#8217;s mind that they can take advantage of when impersonating that ego. The async
then receives a +30 bonus on Impersonation Tests when mimicking the target&#8217;s behavior and social

Language is still a factor in mindlinked communications, but this barrier may be overcome by transmitting

the sleight&#8217;s range; if successful, the async knows they are being watched, but not by whom or what. It does,
however, apply a +30 Perception bonus to spot the observer. This sleight does not register partial attention or
fleeting attention, or simple perception of the async, it only notices targets who are actively observing (even if they
are concealing their observation). This sleight is effective in spotting a tail, as well as finding potential mates in a

example: &#8220;open the airlock,&#8221; or &#8220;hand over the weapon&#8221;). At the gamemaster&#8217;s discretion, the target may
receive a bonus for resisting suggestions that are immediately life threatening (&#8220;jump off the bridge&#8221;)
or that violate their motivations or personal strictures. Suggestions do not need to be carried out
immediately, they may be implanted with a short trigger condition (&#8220;when the alarm goes off, ignore

place, event, or thing in mind, which can be used by a savvy investigator to draw conclusions without the need to
invade the mind directly. Thought Browse may be sustained, allowing the async to continue scanning the

<!--l. 1441--><p class="noindent" >Given the reach of neuroscience in the time of Eclipse Phase, it is easy to think of the mind as programmable
software, as something that can be reverse-engineered, re-coded, upgraded, and patched. To a large degree, this is
true. Aided by nanotechnology, genetics, and cognitive science, neuroscientists have demolished numerous barriers to
understanding the mind&#8217;s structure and functions, and even made great leaps in unveiling the true nature of
consciousness. Genetic tweaks, neuro-mods, and neural implants offer an assortment of options for improving the
brain&#8217;s capabilities. The transhuman mind has become a playground&#8212;and a battlefield. Nanovirii
unleashed during the Fall infected millions, altering their brains in permanent ways, with occasional
outbreaks still occurring a decade later. Cognitive virii roam the mesh, plaguing infomorphs and AIs,
reprogramming mind states. An &#8220;infectious idea&#8221; is now a literal term. In truth, mind editing is not an
easy, safe, and error-proof process&#8212;it is difficult, dangerous, and often flawed. Neuroscience may be
light years ahead of where it was a century ago, but there are many aspects of the brain and neural
functions that continue to confound and elude even the brightest experts and AIs. Technologies like
nanoneural mapping, uploading, digital mind emulation, and artificial intelligence are also comparatively in
their infancy, being mere decades old. Though transhumanity has a handle on how to make these
processes work, it does not always fully understand the underlying mechanisms. Any neurotech will
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
tell you that mucking around in the mind&#8217;s muddy depths is a messy business. Brains are organic
devices, molded by millions of years of unplanned evolutionary development. Each is grown haphazardly,
loaded with evolutionary leftovers, and randomly modified by an unlimited array of life events and
environmental factors. Every mind features numerous mechanisms&#8212;cells, connections, receptors&#8212;that handle a
dizzying array of functions: memory, perception, learning, reasoning, emotion, instinct, consciousness,
and more. Its system of organization and storage is holonomic, diffused, and disorganized. Even the
geneticallymodifi ed and enhanced brains of transhumans are crowded, chaotic, cross-wired places, with each
mind storing its memories, personality, and other defining features in unique ways. What this means is
that though the general architecture and topography of neural networks can be scanned and deduced,
the devil is in the details. Techniques used to modify, repair, or enhance one person&#8217;s mind are not
guaranteed equal success when applied to another&#8217;s brain. For example, the process by which brains store
knowledge, skills, and memories results in a strange chaining process where these memories are linked and
associated with other memories, so attempts to alter one memory can have adverse affects on other
memories. In the end, minds are slippery and dodgy things, and attempts to reshape them rarely go as
planned.

<!--l. 1505--><p class="noindent" >Psychosurgery is the process of selective, surgical alteration of a transhuman mind. It is a separate field from neural
genetic modification (which alters genetic code), neuralware implantation (adding cybernetic or biotech inserts to
the brain or nervous system), or brain hacking (software attacks on computer brains, neural inserts, and
infomorphs), though they are sometimes combined. Psychosurgery is almost always performed on a digital
mind-state, whether that be a real-time emulation, a backup, or a fork. In most cases, the subject&#8217;s mind-state is
copied via the same technology and process as uploading or forking, and run in a simulspace. The subject need
not be willing, and in these cases the subject&#8217;s permissions are restricted. Numerous psychosurgery
simulspace environments are available, each custom-designed for facilitating specific psychosurgical
goals and programmed with a thorough selection of psychotherapy treatment options. The actual
process of psychosurgery breaks down into several stages. First is diagnosis, which can involve the
use of several neuro-imaging techniques on morphed characters, mapping synaptic connections, and
building a neurochemical model. It can also involve complete psychological profiling and psychometric
behavioral testing, including personality tests and simulspace scenario simulations. Digital mind-states
can be compared to records of people with similar symptoms in order to identify related information
clusters. This analysis is used to plan the procedure. The actual implementation of psychosurgical
alteration can involve several methods, depending on the desired results. Applying external modules to the
mind-state is often the best approach, as it doesn&#8217;t meddle with complicated connections and new
inputs are readily interpreted and assimilated. For treatments, mental health software patches compiled
from databases of healthy minds are matched, customized, and applied. Specialized programs may
be run to stimulate certain mental processes for therapeutic purposes. Before an alteration is even
applied, it may first be performed on a fork of the subject and run at accelerated speeds to evaluate
the outcome. Likewise, multiple treatment choices may be applied to time-accelerated forks this way,
allowing the psychosurgeon to test which is likely to work best. Not all psychosurgery is performed
for the subject&#8217;s benefit, of course. Psychosurgery can be used to interrogate or torture prisoners,
erase memories, modify behavior, or inflict crippling impairments. It is also sometimes used for legal
punishment purposes, in an attempt to impair criminal activity. Needless to say, such methods are often
brute-forced rather than fine-tuned, ignoring safety parameters and sometimes resulting in detrimental side
effects.

Psychosurgery skill against the target&#8217;s WIL x 3. Apply modifiers as appropriate from the Psychosurgery Modifiers

alteration becomes a permanent part of the subject&#8217;s ego, and will be copied when uploaded (and sometimes when

lasts for 1 week per 10 points of MoS. If the subject rolls higher, or if the psychosurgeon fails their roll,
the attempt does not work. The timeframe listed for psychosurgical procedures is according to the
patient&#8217;s subjective point of view. Since most subjects are treated in a simulspace, time acceleration may

mind. It is unsurprising then that psychosurgery places stress on the subject&#8217;s mental state and sometimes even
inflicts mental traumas. Each psychosurgery option lists a Stress Value (SV) that is inflicted on the
subject regardless of the tests&#8217; success or failure. If the psychosurgeon achieves an Excellent Success
(MoS 30+), this stress is halved (round down). If the psychosurgeon rolls a Severe Failure (MoF 30+),
the stress is doubled. Alternately, a Severe Failure could result in unintended side effects, such as
affecting other behaviors, emotions, or memories. If a critical success is rolled, no stress is applied at
all. If a critical failure is rolled, however, an automatic trauma is applied in addition to the normal
stress. Some psychosurgery conditions may also affect the SV, as noted on the Psychosurgery Modifiers
table.

psychosurgical mods can be reflected with ego traits, while others might incur modifiers to certain tests or in certain

behavior from the subject&#8217;s psyche. For example, a murderer may be conditioned against acts of aggression, or a
kleptomaniac might be restricted from stealing. Some people seek this adjustment willingly, such as socialite
glitterati who restrict their desire to eat, or an addict who cuts out their craving for a fix. Behavioral control can
also be applied as an unleashing or reinforcement. A companion may desire to eliminate their sexual inhibitions, for
example, or a hypercorp exec may boost his commitment to place work above all else. A character will simply feel
compelled to avoid a behavior that is limited (perhaps suffering a &#8211;10 modifier), but will find it quite difficult to
pursue a behavior that is blocked (requiring a WIL x 3 Test, and suffering a &#8211;20 modifier). They will find themselves
completely incapable of initiating a behavior that is expunged, and if forced into the behavior will
suffer a &#8211;30 modifier and (1d10 <span

compelled to pursue a behavior that is boosted, and will find it hard to avoid engaging in a behavior
that is encouraged (requiring a WIL x 3 Test to avoid). They will have no choice but to engage in
enforced behaviors, and will suffer (1d10 <span

so.

behavioral profiling as a means of identifying people even when they resleeve. Though such systems are far from
perfect, someone&#8217;s unconscious habits and quirks could potentially give them away. Characters who wish to elude
identification in this way may undergo behavioral masking, which seeks to alter and change the character&#8217;s
unconscious habits and social cues. Apply a +30 modifier when defending against such identification systems and
Kinesics Tests.

in the brain and target them for removal. Memory storage is complex and diffused, however, and often linked to
other memories, so removing one memory may affect others (gamemaster discretion). Adding or replacing memories
is a much more complicated operation and requires that such memories be copied from someone who has
experienced them or manufactured with XP software. Even when successfully implanted, fake memories may clash
with other (real) memories unless those are also erased.

personality traits. The personality factors that may be modified is almost unlimited, including traits such as
openness, conscientiousness, altruism, extroversion/ introversion, impulsiveness, curiosity, creativity, confidence,
sexual orientation, and self-control, among others. These traits may be enhanced or reduced to varying degrees.

class="newline" />2nd Quarter 8 AF <br 
class="newline" />FUTURA Project Conclusion&#8212; <br 
class="newline" />Executive Summary Report <br 
class="newline" />Prepared by Dr. Amelia Sheppard <br 
class="newline" />Per  request,  I  have  compiled  a  review  of  the  Futura  Project  and  its  fallout,  5  years  after
     whistleblowers and intense media attention forced us to end the project and release the remaining
     subjects (dubbed &#8220;the Lost&#8221; by popular media).
     <!--l. 1864--><p class="indent" >    Futura was a joint initiative spearheaded by Hanto Genomics and strongly backed by Cognite,
     with numerous other partners (complete list). The project was initially proposed by my mentor,
     Dr. Antonio Pascal, whose team had proven the feasibility of Accelerated Life Experience Training
     (ALET) after a series of pilot studies with two small (N <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x227A; </span>1000) samples. While it is true
     that these early pilot studies used both older subjects and a lesser amount of time dilation,
     the rationale for the Futura Project&#8217;s ambitious program was justified by a remarked decrease
     in transhumanity&#8217;s population due to the Fall, a system-wide stagnant population growth rate
     (blamed  on  various  factors  including  increased  longevity,  available  contraception,  and  rising
     despair over troubling times), as well as a desire to move aggressively into a new technological
     sector in the hopes of obtaining a competitive advantage.
     <!--l. 1885--><p class="indent" >    Futura began immediately in the wake of the Fall with an initial seed population of *** test
     subjects culled from extant genetic material and gestated to between 1 week and 6 months after
     birth. Of these, less than 10% were live births from either a surrogate or genetic birth mother
     who had perished during the Fall. The majority came from our Lunar and Martian labs and were
     brought to term within an exowomb.
     <!--l. 1896--><p class="indent" >    After the sample was selected, all subjects were sleeved into our fast-growth futura-brand
     biomorph bodies and inducted into customized simulspace accelerated learning environments.
     The project made extensive use of emergent technologies and techniques culled from recaptured
     TITAN  facilities,  including  neogenetic  traits  for  the  futura  morphs  and  time  distortion
     applications  for  captive  simulspace  populations.  Futura  ran  concurrently  on  three  different
     research stations with a combined staff of 2,211 researchers and support personnel and 45 AGIs
     custom-programmed for expert child development. Project goals were to raise each child to a
     subjective 18 years life experience in 3 years objective time.
     <!--l. 1913--><p class="indent" >    Despite omnipresent observation and real-time adjusting of the simulspace and educational
     programming for optimal normality, somewhere along the way the project suffered a breakdown
     in quality assurance and parameter monitoring that resulted in a near total failure at empathy
     modeling. We first observed this effect 11 months into the project when the subjects had aged
     to approximately 6 years of age. Incidences of animal cruelty and acting out had spiked, though
     at that time they remained within acceptable standards. Over the next few months this trend
     continued and Dr. Pascal authorized the usage of more authoritative &#8220;parenting&#8221; to attempt to
     correct for the borderline sociopathic behavior that was being exhibited by 23.19% of all subjects
     by the 18- month mark (9 years of age).
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     <!--l. 1932--><p class="indent" >    We now know that these changes had the unintended consequence of suppressing overt displays
     of cruelty and violence and merely taught the majority of subjects how to conceal their psychoses.
     It was also at this time that the first deaths occurred. The initial waves were thought to be
     accidents and both the victim and perpetrator were usually backed up to a week or so of subjective
     time. Post-project analysis now shows that 43.87% of our subjects had engaged in at least one
     act of premeditated murder by the 24-month mark (12 years of age) and the counseling protocols
     were only training them how to lie more effectively.
     <!--l. 1948--><p class="indent" >    It was at this point that myself and Dr. Aaron Bharani advocated pulling the plug on the
     project and bringing the subjects out to real time and intensive counseling. Dr. Pascal vetoed our
     concerns without ever taking them to the board. As the project spiraled towards its conclusion, a
     fork of Dr. Bharani went public at the 34 month mark, inciting a firestorm of controversy. While
     Dr. Pascal successfully tied up investigators, hoping to see the project through to its conclusion,
     the incident at our Legacy research station occurred. Initial findings concluded that one or more of
     the subjects had escaped the program and were in fact responsible for the habitat&#8217;s environmental
     failures and the thousands of subsequent deaths.
     <!--l. 1965--><p class="indent" >    In the face of intense public and private scrutiny, many of the partners involved in the project
     attempted to pull out and even eliminate all traces of their involvement. In the resulting chaos,
     an estimated *** subjects were quietly released into the system&#8217;s general population. It was
     only after this occurred that all known subjects were identified as having been infected with
     the Watts-Macleod strain of the Exsurgent virus, though when and how this occurred remains
     troubling and unclear. Though later orders resulted in all remaining subjects being euthanized
     and/or backed up into cold storage, only of *** the released subjects were recaptured. Of the rest,
     *** pursued sanctuary with sympathetic authorities, *** went public and submitted themselves
     to extensive psychotherapy, *** were killed in incidents of violence and not resurrected, and the
     rest presumably went into hiding.
