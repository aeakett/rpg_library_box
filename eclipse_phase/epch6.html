<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >In a setting where physical looks and capabilities are easily changed at the push of a button, who you are and what
you know is more important than any inborn ability. Skills represent the knowledge your character has, the
accumulated set of experience, education, and inherent know-how possessed by each and every sentient transhuman
in Eclipse Phase. They are what allow you to sneak into a hypercorp station, disable the security systems, hack the
mesh hub, and then impersonate security personnel to make your escape. Your skills represent the one
thing you have no matter what you look like or where you find yourself. When your characters explore
what they can do, their skills, or lack thereof, often determine the margin between success and failure.
Having a well-rounded set of skills is vital to survival and success in Eclipse Phase. The skills below
encompass a wide selection of talents, enough so that each character can be unique in their abilities and
knowledge.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6.1   </span> <a 
 id="x8-5410006.1"></a>Skill overview</h3>
<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >Skills are divided into aptitudes and learned skills (see Character Skills, p. 123). Most (but not all) learned skills are
built on and linked to an aptitude. If a character lacks the specific skill needed in a situation, they may default to
the linked aptitude. You may also choose to specialize in certain skills (see Specializations, p. 123), reflecting an
enhanced knowledge of a particular aspect of a certain skill.
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6.1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x8-5420006.1.1"></a>CORE SKILLS: APTITUDES</h4>
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >Aptitudes represent inherent skills and abilities acquired at birth or during the course of growing up. Aptitudes are
sometimes used for tests, but their primary use is determining the starting point at which learned skills are
developed. Aptitudes determine the starting value of their linked skills. For example, a character with Somatics
aptitude 10 who wishes to purchase points in the Freerunning skill (which is linked to Somatics) would start with a
Freerunning rank of 10 and then buy additionally points in that skill. Aptitudes are also used when a
character doesn&#8217;t posses knowledge of a needed skill (see Defaulting, p. 116). Aptitudes represent the
basic knowledge that a character has acquired regarding rudimentary use of that skill. They may not
have ever received any formal training with the skill, but they can still attempt to use it. Aptitudes
range in value from 1 to 30, with 10 being the unaugmented human average and 15 representing the
average of most genetically modified transhumans. Since aptitudes represent untrained ability, they
are capped at a maximum rating of 30. There are seven different aptitudes that all players possess.
These aptitudes are purchased during character creation (p. 128), but depending on the morph the
character is currently inhabiting, they may find their aptitudes capped by the quality of the morph (see p.
124).
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x8-5430006.1.1"></a>LEARNED SKILLS</h5>
<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >A player&#8217;s learned skills are the most important part of their character, representing the acquired
knowledge they carry with them from morph to morph, knowledge that plays a fundamental role in helping
define the person&#8217;s ego. Learned skills encompass nearly any skill that you might need to use in Eclipse
Phase, and they range in value from 0 to 99. All learned skills have a linked aptitude that is used to
calculate their initial value, and which is also defaulted to if the player does not have that particular
skill.
<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x8-5440006.1.1"></a>SKILL CATEGORIES</h5>
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >Each learned skill is classified as either an Active skill or a Knowledge skill. Active skills represent skills that
typically require physical actions and are used in action scenes within game play. Knowledge skills are more
knowledge-based and intellectual, representing ideas and facts. Knowledge skills may play a less dramatic role in
certain action-oriented game play moments, but they flesh out the character&#8217;s background and interests and are
integral to roleplaying interactions. Active and Knowledge skills are purchased separately during character
creation.
<!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   Active skills are further divided into Combat, Mental, Physical, Psi, Social, Technical, and Vehicle skills. Certain
traits and abilities may apply to specific categories.
<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x8-5450006.1.1"></a>FIELD SKILLS</h5>
<!--l. 92--><p class="noindent" >Some learned skills are field skills, meaning that when this skill is chosen a particular field of emphasis must also be
selected. For example, the skill of Academics requires the character to specify a specific academic discipline in which
they are knowledgeable, such as Biology, Chemistry, or Xenosociology. Field skills are written as &#8220;[skill]: [field];&#8221; for
example: &#8220;Art: Painting.&#8221; Field skills can be taken multiple times, choosing a different area of emphasis each time,
reflecting skills in different fields; that is to say, each field is a separate skill. Several suggested fields are listed
for each field skill, but gamemasters and players may also cooperate to create others that fit their
games.
<!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >   Field skills may also have specializations; for example, Professional: Accounting (Money Laundering).
<!--l. 108--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x8-5460006.1.1"></a>PSI SKILLS</h5>
<!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" >Psi refers to the ability to perceive and manipulate biological minds via psi waves and/or other inexplicable
phenomena. Due to the uniqueness of this ability, characters that wish to wield psi must acquire the
Psi
<!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >   trait (p. 147). Psi use also requires a number of specialized skills (Control, Psi Assault, and Sense) that reflect
special training characters acquire to tap into their psi powers. Psi skills may not be defaulted on; the only way to
use a psi skill is to possess the trait along with training in that skill. For more details, see Psi, p.
220.
<!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x8-5470006.1.1"></a>SPECIALIZATIONS</h5>
<!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" >Any character may opt to specialize in a given skill (see Specializations, p. 123). This specialization reflects
increased knowledge in one particular aspect of the skill. Many of the skills offered below include sample
specializations. Gamemasters and players are encouraged to develop other specialization ideas together for their
campaigns.
<!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >   Specialization provides a +10 modifier when using that skill in a situation appropriate to that
specialization.
<!--l. 136--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6.2   </span> <a 
 id="x8-5480006.2"></a>USING SKILLS</h3>
<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >Whenever a character wants to do something using a skill, they must succeed at a skill test (see Making Tests, p.
115). The difficulty of the action is applied as a modifier, as are any other extenuating circumstances that may affect
the test (see Difficulty and Modifiers, p. 115). As with other types of tests, all skill tests are successful when the
character rolls less than or equal to the test&#8217;s target number after any modifiers have been applied.
In the case of skill tests, the target number is the character&#8217;s skill rating with that particular skill.
Modifiers representing difficulty and other factors are applied directly to the target number (see Difficulty
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
and Modifiers, p. 115). A roll of a 00 is always a success, regardless of modifiers, and a result of 99
is always a failure, again despite any modifiers that may increase a character&#8217;s target number over
100. Standard critical success and failure rules apply to skill tests (see Criticals: Rolling Doubles, p.
116), so any time a character rolls a double (i.e. 00, 11, 22, 33, etc.) they score a critical success or
failure.
<!--l. 157--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x8-5490006.2"></a>DEFAULTING</h5>
<!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >Sometimes you lack the skill needed in a certain situation. In these instances, characters may default their skill
test to the linked aptitude. This reflects the fact that most learned skills are developed from some
sort of baseline physical ability. Even though you may not know how to do something, you&#8217;ve likely
seen how it&#8217;s done at some point or have some idea of how to do it, or can at least take a shot at it.
Naturally, you&#8217;re not as good as someone who has training in that skill, but it still allows you to make an
attempt.
<!--l. 168--><p class="indent" >   Not all skills can be defaulted. Some skills are simply too complex or obscure, or demand special
knowledge or ability, for someone to attempt their use untrained. For example, brain surgery or most
psi skills are simply beyond anyone who doesn&#8217;t have that ability or the knowledge of what they&#8217;re
attempting.
<!--l. 175--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x8-5500006.2"></a>DEFAULTING TO FIELD SKILLS</h5>
<!--l. 176--><p class="noindent" >In some cases, a character may not possess the particular field skill that a test calls for, but they may be skilled in
another related field. For example, a test to conduct an alien autopsy might call for an Academics: Xenobiology roll,
but a character who doesn&#8217;t have that skill may be allowed to default to Academics: Biology instead. The
gamemaster decides if and when to allow this, perhaps applying a modifier to the test based on the difference
between fields.
<!--l. 186--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x8-5510006.2"></a>DEFAULTING TO RELATED SKILLS</h5>
<!--l. 187--><p class="noindent" >If the gamemaster allows it, characters may default to a related skill that also has some relevance to the test at
hand. For example, a character skilled in Kinetic Weapons might not be trained in the use of a laser, but they
know enough to point at the target and pull the trigger. Likewise, a character might not be skilled in
Investigation, but the gamemaster could still allow them to use their Perception skill instead in order to
realize that a body had been moved from the place where it had been shot. In situations like this,
when the gamemaster allows defaulting to a related skill, a &#8211;30 modifier should be applied to the
test.
<!--l. 200--><p class="indent" >
        <div class="example">
     <!--l. 201--><p class="indent" >    <span 
class="cmbx-10">Example </span><br 
class="newline" />Srit is wandering through a black market souk on Mars, trying to find a particular piece of sensory
     equipment. The gamemaster calls for a Scrounging Test, but Srit does not have that skill. She
     could default her INT of 22, but instead she asks the gamemaster if she can default to the related
     skill of Perception, which she has at 82. The gamemaster agrees, and so Srit rolls against a target
     number of 52 (82 &#8211; 30).</div>
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 216--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x8-5520006.2"></a>COMPLEMENTARY SKILLS</h5>
<!--l. 217--><p class="noindent" >Sometimes more than one skill may apply to a particular test, or knowledge in one area can aid your skill in
another. In this case, the gamemaster may apply a modifier to the skill test based on the strength of the
complementing skill, as noted on the Complementary Skill Bonus table.
<!--l. 224--><p class="indent" >
        <div class="example">
     <!--l. 225--><p class="indent" >    <span 
class="cmbx-10">Example </span><br 
class="newline" />Dav is hoping to persuade a brinker pilot to take him to an isolated habitat that doesn&#8217;t welcome
     visitors. To impress upon the pilot that he is a friend of these particular isolates, he calls on
     his knowledge of their particular cultural practices (Interests: Religious Cults skill at 45). The
     gamemaster allows this and applies a +20 modifier to Dav&#8217;s Persuasion Test.</div>

<!--l. 323--><p class="noindent" >In rare cases, a test may call for using an aptitude only, rather than a learned skill. This should only
occur when no learned skills are appropriate to the test, and these circumstances are usually noted in
the rules. Aptitude-only tests must be handled carefully, as the range of aptitude ratings (1&#8211;30) is
typically much smaller than the rating of learned skills (0&#8211;99). For this reason, most aptitude tests
should use a target number equal to the aptitude x 3. In rare cases where the test is more difficult,
the gamemaster may simply use an aptitude x 2, or just the straight aptitude rating. In some cases,
more than one aptitude may be relevant to the test, and so they may be added together to derive the
target number. What follows are a few examples where an aptitudeonly test might be appropriate.
Gamemasters may call for similar tests in other situations, but learned skills should be used whenever
possible.

     avoid genetic defects and optimized for certain characteristics, while exalts are tweaked to make
     them superior across the board: they are more attractive, more athletic, have greater cognitive
     capacity, and are more attuned to the world around them than their unaugmented kin.</div>

theoretical knowledge of the skill&#8212;for example, Academics: Armorer or Academics: Interrogation.
<br

For example, Academics: Chemistry could be used to identify a particular substance, understand an
unusual chemical reaction, or determine what elements are needed to nanofabricate something that
requires exotic materials. At the gamemaster&#8217;s discretion, some Academics-related tests might not be

class="cmbx-10">What it is: </span>Skilled animal handlers are able to train and control a wide variety of natural and transgenic animals,
including partial uplifts. Though many animal species went extinct during the Fall, a few &#8220;ark&#8221; and zoo
habitats keep some species alive, and many others can be resurrected from genetic samples. Exotic
animals are considered a sign of prestige among the hypercorp elites, and guard animals are occasionally
used to protect high-security installations. Likewise, many habitats and settlements employ small
armies of partially uplifted, genetically modified, and behavior-controlled creatures for sanitation or
other purposes. Many new and strange breeds of animal are created daily to serve a variety of roles.
<br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="cmbx-10">When you use it: </span>Animal Handling is used whenever you are trying to manipulate an animal, whether
your intent is to calm it down, keep it from attacking, intimidate it, acquire its trust, or goad it into
attacking. Your Margin of Success determines how effective you are at convincing the creature. At the
gamemaster&#8217;s discretion, modifiers may be applied to the test. Likewise, winning an animal over may
sometimes take time, and so could be handled as a Task Action with a timeframe of five minutes or more.

     depending on the complexity of the action. Apply modifiers to this test based on the relative
     intelligence of the animal being trained, how domestic it is, and the complexity of the task. Once
     an animal has been trained, commanding it is treated as a Simple Success Test (p. 118) except for
     unusual or stressful situations, in which case the trainer receives a +30 modifier on their Animal
     Handling Tests when convincing the animal to complete the trained action.</div>

class="cmbx-10">USING KNOWLEDGE SKILLS </span><br 
class="newline" />At first glance, it may seem that Knowledge skills have fewer in-game applications than Active
     skills. To some degree this is the case. The importance of Knowledge skills, however, should not be
     underestimated. While they play a role in analyzing clues and solving mysteries, the real value of
     Knowledge skills is in helping the characters&#8212;and the players&#8212;understand the world of Eclipse
     Phase. In particular these skills can be used to make plans, assess a situation, identify strengths
     and weaknesses, evaluate worth, make comparisons, forecast probable outcomes, or understand
     the applicable science, socio-economic factors, or cultural or historical context. For example, a
     group of characters looking to break into a facility could use Profession: Security Procedures to
     evaluate the defenses, Academic: Architecture to identify covert points of entry, Interests: Sports
     to plan their infiltration at a time when the guards are likely to be distracted, Interests: Triads
     to identify a local crime group that can sell them breaking and entering gear, and Art: Sculpture
     when picking a valuable art piece with which to bribe an insider. When used appropriately, these
     skills can be just as beneficial as the Active skills used to break inside, if not more so because the
     plan is more likely to succeed as a result of this preparation. It is largely up to the gamemaster to
     enforce how useful Knowledge skills are in their game. The easiest way to reinforce their relevance
     is to penalize characters who don&#8217;t take advantage of them. For example, characters who didn&#8217;t
     use their Profession: Security Procedures in the example above might end up being surprised
     when they run across a security system they are not prepared to deal with, forcing them to
     improvise or even abandon their plans.</div>
