<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >In every game, there comes a time when the gamemaster must decide if a character succeeds or fails in an action.
This is when the players roll dice and the characters&#8217; stats and abilities come into play. This chapter defines the core
mechanics and rules that govern the outcomes of events in Eclipse Phase.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.1   </span> <a 
 id="x6-2970004.1"></a>A note on terminology and Gender</h3>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >The Eclipse Phase setting raises a number of interesting questions about gender and personal identity. What does it
mean when you are born female but you are occupying a male body? When it comes to language
and editing, this also poses a number of interesting questions for what pronouns to use. The English
language has a bit of a bias towards male-gendered pronouns that we hope to avoid in these rules. For
purposes of this game, we&#8217;ve sidestepped some of these gender neutrality quandaries by adopting the
&#8220;Singular They&#8221; rule. What this means is that rather than just going with male pronouns (&#8220;he&#8221;)
or switching between gendered pronouns (&#8220;he&#8221; in one chapter, &#8220;she&#8221; in the next), we have adopted
the use of &#8220;they&#8221; even when referring to a single person. To some folks, this is bad grammar, but
there is actually some good evidence that this usage has strong historical roots (look it up), and it
certainly gives our editors fewer headaches. When referring to specifi c characters, we use the gendered
pronoun appropriate to the character&#8217;s personal gender identity, no matter the sex of the morph they are
in.
<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.2   </span> <a 
 id="x6-2980004.2"></a>Core rules</h3>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x6-2990004.2.1"></a>The ultimate rule</h4>
<!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >One rule in Eclipse Phase outweighs all of the others: have fun. This means that you should never let the
rules get in the way of the game. If you don&#8217;t like a rule, change it. If you can&#8217;t find a rule, make
one up. If you disagree over a rule&#8217;s interpretation, flip a coin. Try not to let rules interfere with the
game&#8217;s flow and mood. If you&#8217;re in the middle of a really good scene or intense roleplaying and a rule
suddenly comes into question, don&#8217;t stop the game to look it up and argue about it. Just wing it, make a
decision quickly, and move on. You can always look the rule up later so you&#8217;ll remember it next time. If
there are disagreements over a rule&#8217;s interpretation, remember that the gamemaster gets the final
say.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >   This rule also means that you shouldn&#8217;t let the story be guided solely by rolls of the dice. The element of chance
that dice rolls provide lends a sense of randomness, uncertainty, and surprise to the game. Sometimes this is
exciting, like when a character makes an unexpectedly difficult roll and saves the day. At other times, it is brutal,
such as when a lucky shot from an opponent takes one of the characters out for good in a fight. If the
gamemaster wants a scenario to result in a pre-planned dramatic outcome and an unexpected die roll
threatens that plan, they should feel free to ignore that roll and move the story in the direction they
desire.
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x6-3000004.2.2"></a>Dice</h4>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >Eclipse Phase uses two ten-sided dice (each noted as a d10) for random rolls. In most cases, the rules will call for a
percentile roll, noted as d100, meaning that you roll two ten-sided dice, choosing one to count first, and then read
them as a result between 0 and 99 (with a roll of 00 counting as zero, not 100). The first die counts
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
as the tens digit, and the second die counts as the ones digit. For example, you roll two ten-sided
dice, one red and one black, calling out red first. The red one rolls a 1 and the black die rolls a 6,
for a result of 16. Some sets of d10s, as shown above, are specifically marked for easier rolling and
reading.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   Occasionally the rules will call for individual die rolls, with each individual ten-sided die listed as a d10. If the
rules call for several dice to be rolled, it will be noted as 2d10, 3d10, and so on. When multiple ten-sided dice are
rolled in these instances, the results are added together. For example, a 3d10 roll of 4, 6, and 7 counts as 17. On d10
rolls, a result of 0 is treated as a 10, not a zero.
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   Most players of Eclipse Phase can get by with having two ten-sided dice, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to have more
on hand. These dice can be purchased at your friendly local game store or borrowed from another
gamer.
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.2.3   </span> <a 
 id="x6-3010004.2.3"></a>Making tests</h4>
<!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >In Eclipse Phase, your character is bound to find themself in adrenalin-pumping action scenes, high- stress social
situations, lethal combats, spine-tingling investigations, and similar situations filled with drama, risk, and adventure.
When your character is embroiled in these scenarios, you determine how well they do by making tests&#8212;rolling dice
to determine if they succeed or fail, and to what degree.
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   You make tests in Eclipse Phase by rolling d100 and comparing the result to a target number. The target
number is typically determined by one of your character&#8217;s skills (discussed below) and ranges between 1 and 98. If
you roll less than or equal to the target number, you succeed. If you roll higher than the target number, you
fail.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   A roll of 00 is always considered a success. A roll of 99 is always a failure.
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >
        <div class="example">
     <!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >    Jaqui&#8217;s character needs to make a skill test. Her skill is 55. Jaqui takes two ten-sided dice and
     rolls a 53&#8212;she succeeds! If she had rolled a 55, she still would have been successful, but any roll
     higher than that would have been a failure.</div>
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.2.4   </span> <a 
 id="x6-3020004.2.4"></a>Target numbers</h4>
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >As noted above, the target number for a d100 roll in Eclipse Phase is usually the skill rating. Occasionally, however,
a different figure will be used. In some cases, an aptitude score is used, which makes for much harder tests as
aptitude scores are usually well below 50 (see Aptitudes, <a 
href="#x6-3430004.5.5">4.5.5<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:aptitudes --></a>). In other tests, the target number will be an aptitude
rating x 2 or x 3 or two aptitudes added together. In these cases, the test description will note what rating(s) to
use.
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.2.5   </span> <a 
 id="x6-3030004.2.5"></a>When to make tests</h4>
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >The gamemaster decides when a character must make a test. As a rule of thumb, tests are called for whenever there
is a chance that a character might fail at an action or when success or failure may have an effect on the
ongoing story. Tests are also called for whenever two or more characters act in opposition to one another
(for example, if they are arm wrestling or haggling over a price). On the other hand, routine use of a
skill by someone with at least a rating of 30 in that skill can be assumed to be successful with no
test.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   It is not necessary to make tests for everyday, run-of-the-mill activities, such as getting dressed or checking your
email (especially in Eclipse Phase, where so many activities are automatically handled by the machines
around you). Even an activity such as driving a car does not call for dice rolls as long as you have a
small modicum of skill. A test might be necessary, however, if you happen to be driving while bleeding
to death or are pursuing a gang of motorcycle-riding scavengers through the ruins of a devastated
city.
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   Knowing when to call for tests and when to let the roleplaying flow without interruption is a skill every
gamemaster must acquire. Sometimes it is better to simply make a call without rolling dice in order to maintain the
pacing of the game. Likewise, in certain circumstances the gamemaster may decide to make tests for a character in
secret, without the player noticing. If an enemy is trying to sneak past a character on guard, for example, the
gamemaster will alert the player that something is amiss if they ask them to make a perception test.
This means that the gamemaster should keep a copy of each character&#8217;s record sheet on hand at all
times.
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.2.6   </span> <a 
 id="x6-3040004.2.6"></a>Difficulty and modifiers</h4>
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >The measure of a test&#8217;s difficulty is reflected in its modifiers. Modifiers are adjustments made to the target number
(not the roll), either raising or lowering it. A test of average difficulty will have no modifiers, whereas
actions that are easier will have positive modifiers (raising the target number, making success more
likely) and harder actions will have negative modifiers (lowering the target number, making success less
likely). It is the gamemaster&#8217;s job to determine if a particular test is harder or easier than normal
and to what degree (as illustrated on the Test Difficulty table) and to then apply the appropriate
modifier.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   Other factors might also play a role in a test, applying additional modifiers aside from the test&#8217;s general level of
difficulty. These factors include the environment, equipment (or lack thereof), and the health of the character,
among other things. The character might be using superior tools, working in poor conditions, or even wounded, and
each of these factors must be taken into account, applying additional modifiers to the target number and adjusting
the likelihood of success or failure.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   For simplicity, modifiers are applied in multiples of 10 and come in three levels of severity: Minor (+/&#8211;10),
Moderate (+/&#8211;20), and Major (+/&#8211;30). Any number of modifiers may be applied, as the gamemaster deems
appropriate, but the cumulative modifiers may not exceed + or &#8211; 60.
<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >
        <div class="example">
     <!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >    Jaqui is attempting to leap from one door to another across a large chamber in zero gravity.
     She&#8217;s in a hurry. If she misses the door, she&#8217;ll lose valuable time, so the gamemaster calls for a
     Freefall Skill Test. Jaqui&#8217;s Freefall skill is 46. Unfortunately the chamber is filled with floating
     debris that could get in her way. The gamemaster determines this is a Moderate modifier, reducing
     the target number by 20. Jaqui must roll a 26 or less to succeed.</div>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.2.7   </span> <a 
 id="x6-3050004.2.7"></a>Criticals: rolling doubles</h4>
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >Any time both dice come up with the same number &#8211; 00, 11, 22, 33, 44, etc.&#8212;you have scored a critical success or
critical failure, depending on whether your roll also beat your target number. 00 is always a critical success, whereas
99 is always a critical failure. Rolling doubles means that a little something extra happened with the outcome of the
test, either positive or negative. Criticals have a very specific application in combat tests (see <a 
href="epch7.html#x9-6340007.5">7.5<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:combat --></a>), but for all other
purposes the gamemaster decides what exactly went wrong or right in a specific situation. Criticals can
be used to amplify a success or failure: you finish with a flourish or fail so spectacularly that you
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
remain the butt of jokes for weeks to come. They can also result in some sort of unexpected secondary
effect: you repair the device and improve its performance; or you fail to shoot your enemy and hit an
innocent bystander. Alternately, a critical can be used to give a boost (or a hindrance) to a follow-up
action. For example, you not only spot a clue, but you immediately suspect it to be red herring; or you
not only fail to strike the target, but your weapon breaks, leaving you defenseless. Gamemasters are
encouraged to be inventive with their use of criticals and choose results that create comedy, drama, or
tension.
<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >
        <div class="example">
     <!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >    Audrey  is  attempting  to  intimidate  a  low-level  triad  mook  into  giving  her  information.
     Unfortu- nately she rolls a 99&#8212;a critical failure. Not only does she fail to scare the guy, but she

used to determine how well a character exercises a particular skill or ability.
<!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >   Success Tests are handled exactly as described under Making Tests, p. 115. The player rolls d100 against a target
number equal to the character&#8217;s skill +/&#8211; modifiers. If they roll equal to or less than the target number, the test

longer.
<!--l. 140--><p class="indent" >   Players may choose to take extra time when their character undertakes an action, meaning that they choose to
be especially careful when performing the action in order to enhance their chance of success. For every minute of
extra time they take, they increase their target number by +10. Once they&#8217;ve modified their target number to over
99, they are practically assured of success, so the gamemaster can waive the dice roll and grant them an automatic
success. Note that the maximum +60 modifier rule still applies, so if their skill is under 40 to start with, taking the
time may still not guarantee a favorable outcome. You may take the time even when defaulting (see Defaulting, p.
116).
<!--l. 142--><p class="indent" >   Taking extra time is a solid choice when time is not a factor to the character, as it eliminates the chance that
a critical failure will be rolled and allows the player to skip needless dice rolling. For certain tests
it may not be appropriate, however, if the gamemaster decides that no amount of extra time will
increase the likelihood of success. In that case, the gamemaster simply rules that taking the time has no
effect.

failure, however, the test is assumed to succeed. The roll determines whether the character succeeds
strongly (rolls equal to or less than the target number) or succeeds weakly (rolls above the target
number).

doing it. This is usually true of situations where the challenge is not only difficult but the action must be pulled off
with finesse. Tests of this sort may call for a certain Margin of Success (MoS)&#8212;an amount by which
the character must roll under the target number. For example, a character facing a target number of
55 and a MoS of 20 must roll equal to or less than a 35 to succeed at the level the situation calls
for.
<!--l. 164--><p class="indent" >
        <div class="example">
     <!--l. 165--><p class="indent" >    An enemy has thrown an incendiary device near Stoya. She has only a moment to act and
     decides to try to kick it away from herself. Even better, she hopes to kick it into the open
     maintenance hatch a dozen meters away. The gamemaster determines that in order to kick it
     into the hatch, Stoya needs to succeed with an MoS of 30. Her Unarmed Combat skill is 66, so
     Stoya needs to roll 66 or less to kick the device away (though she may still be damaged when
     it explodes), and 36 or less to kick it into the hatch (in which case she will be completely safe
     when it detonates). She rolls a 44&#8212;missing the hatch, but scoring a critical success! Her aim is
     off, but the gamemaster decides that the device rebounds off some machinery and falls into the
     hatch anyway.</div>

<div class="houserule"><p>Instead of subtracting the roll from the target number to determine the Margin of Success, simply use the rolled number as the Margin of Success. Higher rolls are higher margins of success, lower rolls are lower. This means there is no need to subtract two numbers to calculate the MoS - so long as the roll is under the target number, the rolled number tells you the MoS. Opposed rolls use this method to calculate the winner, so this variation is more consistent with those rules too.</p></div>

<!--l. 168--><p class="indent" >   At other times, it may be important to know how badly a character fails, as determined by a Margin of Failure
(MoF), which is the amount by which the character rolled over the target number. In some cases, a test may
note that a character who fails with a certain MoF may suffer additional consequences for failing so
dismally.

accordingly. Characters working on Task actions may also interrupt their work to do something else and
then pick up where they left off, unless the gamemaster rules that the action requires continuous and
uninterrupted attention. Similar to taking the time (p. 117), a character may rush the job on a Task action,
taking a penalty on the test in order to decrease the timeframe. The character must declare they are
rushing the job before they roll the test. For every 10 percent they wish to reduce the timeframe, they
incur a &#8211;10 modifier on the test (to a maximum reduction of 60 percent with a maximum modifier of
&#8211;60).

<!--l. 256--><p class="noindent" >In order to gauge and quantify what your character is merely good at and what they excel in&#8212;or what they are
clueless about and suck at&#8212;Eclipse Phase uses a number of measurement factors: stats, skills, traits, and

<!--l. 261--><p class="noindent" >Your character concept defines who you are in the Eclipse Phase universe. You&#8217;re not just a run-of-the-mill plebeian
with a boring and mundane life, you&#8217;re a participant in a post- apocalyptic transhuman future who gets caught up
in intrigue, terrible danger, unspeakable horrors, and scrambling for survival. Much like a character in an adventure,
drama, or horror story, you are a person to whom interesting things happen&#8212;or if not, you make them
happen. This means your character needs a distinct personality and sense of identity. At the very
least, you should be able to sum up your character concept in a single sentence, such as &#8220;cantankerous
neotenic renegade archaeologist with anger management issues&#8221; or &#8220;thrill-seeking social animal who is
dangerously obsessed with conspiracy theories and mysteries.&#8221; If it helps, you can always borrow ideas from
characters you&#8217;ve seen in movies or books, modifying them to fit your tastes. Your character&#8217;s concept will
likely be influenced by two important factors: background and faction. Your background denotes the
circumstances under which your character was raised, while your faction indicates the post-Fall grouping to
which you most recently held ties and allegiances. Both of these play a role in character creation (p.
128).

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.5.2   </span> <a 
 id="x6-3290004.5.2"></a>motivations</h4>
<!--l. 266--><p class="noindent" >The clash of ideologies and memes is a core component of Eclipse Phase, and so every character has three
motivations&#8212;personal memes that dominate the character&#8217;s interests and pursuits. These memes may be as abstract
as ideologies the character adheres to or supports&#8212;for example, social anarchism, Islamic jihad, or bioconservatism
-&#8212; or they may be as concrete as specific outcomes the character desires, such as revealing a certain hypercorp&#8217;s
corruption, obtaining massive personal wealth, or winning victories for uplifted rights. A motivation
may also be framed in opposition to something; for example, anti-capitalism or anti-pod-citizenship,
or staying out of jail. In essence, these are ideas that motivate the character to do the things they
do. Motivation is best noted as a term or short phrase on the character sheet, marked with a + (in
favor of) or &#8211; (opposed to). Players are encouraged to develop their own distinct motivations for their
characters, in cooperation with the gamemaster. Some examples are provided on p. 138. In game terms,
motivation is used to help define the character&#8217;s personality and influence their actions for roleplaying
purposes. It also serves to regain Moxie points (<a href="epch4.html#x6-3400004.5.4"><img src="images/external.png" /></a>) and earn Rez Points for character advancement (p.
152).
<!--l. 268--><p class="indent" >   Motivational goals may be short-term or long-term, and may in fact change for a character over time. Short-term
goals are more immediately obtainable objectives or short-lived interests, and these goals are likely to change once
achieved. Even so, they should reflect intentions that will take more than one game session to reach, possibly
covering weeks or months. These short-term goals may in fact tie directly into the gamemaster&#8217;s current storyline.
Examples include conducting a full analysis of an alien artifact, completing a research project, or living life as an
uplifted dog for a while. Long-term goals reflect deeply rooted beliefs or tasks that require major efforts and time
(possibly lifelong) to achieve. For example, finding the lost backup of a sibling missing since the Fall, overthrowing
an autocratic regime, or making first contact with a new alien species. For purposes of awarding Moxie or Rez
Points, long-term goals are best broken down into obtainable chunks. Someone whose goal is to track
down the murderer who killed their parents when they were a child, for example, can be considered to
achieve that goal every time they discover some evidence that brings them a little closer to solving the
puzzle.

<!--l. 273--><p class="noindent" >Eclipse Phase&#8217;s setting dictates that a distinction must be made between a character&#8217;s ego (their ingrained self, their
personality, and inherent traits that perpetuate in continuity) and their morph (their ephemeral physical&#8212;and
sometimes virtual&#8212;form). A character&#8217;s morph may die while the character&#8217;s ego lives on (assuming appropriate
backup measures have been taken), transplanted into a new morph. Morphs are expendable, but your character&#8217;s
ego represents the ongoing, continuous life path of your character&#8217;s mind, personality, memories, knowledge, and so
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
forth. This continuity may be interrupted by an unexpected death (depending on how recent the backup was
made), or by forking (see p. 273), but it represents the totality of the character&#8217;s mental state and
experiences.
<!--l. 275--><p class="indent" >   Some aspects of your character&#8212;particularly skills, along with some stats and traits&#8212;belong to your
character&#8217;s ego, which means they stay with them throughout the character&#8217;s development. Some stats and
traits, however, are determined by morph, as noted, and so will change if your character leaves one
body and takes on another. Morphs may also affect other skills and stats, as detailed in the morph
description.

<!--l. 444--><p class="noindent" >Traits include a range of inherent qualities and features that help define your character. Some traits are positive, in
that they give your character a bonus to certain stats, skills, or tests, or otherwise give them an edge in certain
situations. Others are negative, in that they impair your abilities or occasionally create a glitch in your plans. Some
traits apply to a character&#8217;s ego, staying with them from body to body, while others only apply to a character&#8217;s
morph.
<!--l. 446--><p class="indent" >   Traits are purchased during character generation. Positive traits cost customization points (CP), while negative
traits give you extra CP to spend on other things (see Traits, p. 145). The maximum number of CP you may spend
on traits is 50, while the maximum you may gain from negative traits is 50. In rare circumstances&#8212;and only
with gamemaster approval&#8212;traits may be purchased, bought off, or inflicted during gameplay (see p.
153).

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.5.7   </span> <a 
 id="x6-3470004.5.7"></a>Character morph</h4>
<!--l. 451--><p class="noindent" >In Eclipse Phase, your body is disposable. If your body gets old, sick, or too heavily damaged, you can digitize your
consciousness and download it into a new body. The process isn&#8217;t cheap or easy, but it offers effective
immortality&#8212;as long as you remember to back yourself up and don&#8217;t go insane. The term morph
is used to describe any type of form your mind inhabits, whether it be a vat-grown clone sleeve, a
synthetic robotic shell, a part-bio/part-flesh pod, or even the purely electronic software state of an
infomorph.
<!--l. 453--><p class="indent" >   You purchase your starting morph during character creation (see p. 128). This is likely the morph you
were born with (assuming you were born), though it may simply be another morph you&#8217;ve moved
onto.
<!--l. 455--><p class="indent" >   Physical looks aside, your morph has a large impact on your characteristics. Your morph determines certain
physical stats, such as Durability and Wound Threshold, and it may also influence Initiative and Speed. Morphs
may also modify some of your aptitudes and learned skills. Some morphs come pre-loaded with specific traits and
implants, representing how it was crafted, and you can always bling yourself out with more implants if you
choose (see Implants, p. 126). All of these factors are noted in the individual morph descriptions (see p.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
139).
<!--l. 457--><p class="indent" >   If you plan on switching your current morph to another during gameplay, you may first want to back yourself
up (see Backups and Uploads, p. 268). Backing up regularly is always a smart option in case you
suffer an accidental or untimely death. Acquiring a new morph is not always easy, especially if you
want it pre-loaded according to certain specifications. The full process is detailed under Resleeving, p.
271.
<!--l. 459--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x6-3480004.5.7"></a>Aptitude Maximums</h5>
<!--l. 462--><p class="noindent" >Every morph has an aptitude maximum, sometimes modified by traits. This maximum represents the highest value
at which the character may use that aptitude while inhabiting that morph, reflecting an inherent limitation in some
morphs. If a character&#8217;s aptitude exceeds the aptitude maximum of their morph, they must use it at the maximum
value for the duration of the time they remain in that morph. This may also affect the skills linked to that aptitude,
which must be modified appropriately.
<!--l. 464--><p class="indent" >   Some implants, gear, psi, and other factors may modify a character&#8217;s natural aptitudes. These augmented values
may exceed a morph&#8217;s aptitude maximums, as they represent external factors boosting the morph&#8217;s ability. No
aptitude, however, augmented or not, may ever exceed a value of 40. Innate ability only takes a person so far&#8212;after
that point, actual skill is what counts.
<!--l. 466--><p class="indent" >
        <div class="example">
     <!--l. 467--><p class="indent" >    Eva has a Cognition aptitude of 25. She is unfortunately forced to sleeve into a flat morph
     with an aptitude maximum of 20. For the duration of the period she inhabits that morph, her
     Cognition is reduced to 20, which also impacts all of her COG-linked skills, reducing them by 5.</div>

 id="x6-3490004.6"></a>Things characters use</h3>
<!--l. 473--><p class="noindent" >In the advanced technological setting of Eclipse Phase, characters don&#8217;t get by on their wits and morphs alone;
they take advantage of their credit and reputation to acquire gear and implants and use their social
networks to gather information. Some characters also have the capability to use mental powers known as
psi.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.6.1   </span> <a 
 id="x6-3500004.6.1"></a>Identity</h4>
<!--l. 478--><p class="noindent" >In an age of ubiquitous computing and omnipresent surveillance, privacy is a thing of the past&#8212;who
you are and what you do is easily accessed online. Characters in Eclipse Phase, however, are often
involved in secretive or less-than-legal activities, so the way to keep the bloggers, news, paparazzi,
and law off your back is to make extensive use of fake IDs. While Firewall often provides covers for
its sentinel agents, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to keep a few extra personas in reserve, in case matters ever go
out the airlock in a hurry. Thankfully, the patchwork allegiances of city-state habitats and faction
stations means that identities aren&#8217;t too difficult to fake, and the ability to switch morphs makes it
even easier. On the other hand, anyone with a copy of your biometrics or geneprint is going to have
an edge tracking you down or finding any forensic traces you leave behind (for more on ID, see p.
279).

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.6.2   </span> <a 
 id="x6-3510004.6.2"></a>Social networks</h4>
<!--l. 483--><p class="noindent" >Social networks represent people the character knows and social groups with which they interact. These contacts,
friends, and acquaintances are not just maintained in person, but also through heavy Mesh contact. Social software
allows people to stay updated on what the people they know are doing, where they are, and what they are interested
in, right up to the minute. Social networks also incorporate the online projects of individual members, whether it&#8217;s a
mesh-site loaded with a band member&#8217;s songs, a personal archive of stored media, a decade of blog entries reviewing
the best places to score cheap electronics, or a depository of research papers and studies someone has worked on or
finds interesting.
<!--l. 485--><p class="indent" >   In game play, social networks are quite useful to characters. Their friends list is an essential resource&#8212;a pool of
people you can actively poll for ideas, troll for news, listen to for the latest rumors, buy or sell gear from, hit up for
expert advice, and even ask for favors.
<!--l. 487--><p class="indent" >   While a character&#8217;s social networks are nebulous and constantly shifting, the use of them is not. A character
takes advantage of their social networks via the Networking (Field) skill (p. 182). The exact use of this skill is
covered under Reputation and Social Networks, p. 285.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.6.3   </span> <a 
 id="x6-3520004.6.3"></a>Cred</h4>
<!--l. 492--><p class="noindent" >The Fall devastated the global economies and currencies of the past. In the years of reconsolidation that followed,
the hypercorps and governments inaugurated a new system-wide electronic monetary system. Called credit, this
currency is backed by all of the large capitalist-oriented factions and is used to trade for goods and services
as well for other financial transactions. Credit is mainly transferred electronically, though certified
credit chips are also common (and favored for their anonymity). Hardcopy bills are even used in some
habitats.
<!--l. 494--><p class="indent" >   Depending on your background or faction, your character may be given an amount of credit at the start of the
game. During game play, your character must earn credit the old-fashioned way: by earning or stealing
it.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.6.4   </span> <a 
 id="x6-3530004.6.4"></a>Rep</h4>
<!--l. 499--><p class="noindent" >Capitalism is no longer the only economy in town. The development of nanofabricators allowed for the existence of
post-scarcity economies, a fact eagerly taken advantage of by anarchist factions and others. When anyone can
make anything, concepts like property and wealth become irrelevant. The advent of functional gift and
communist economies, among other alternative economic models, means that in such systems you
can acquire any goods or services you need via free exchange, reciprocity, or barter&#8212;presuming you
are a contributing member of such a system and respected by your peers. Likewise, art, creativity,
innovation, and various forms of cultural expression have a much higher worth than they do in capitalist
economies.
<!--l. 501--><p class="indent" >   In alternative economies, money is often meaningless, but reputation matters. Your reputation score represents
your social capital&#8212;how esteemed you are to your peers. Rep can be increased by positively influencing,
contributing to, or helping individuals or groups, and it can be decreased through antisocial behavior. In anarchist
habitats, your likelihood of obtaining things that you need is entirely based on how you are viewed by
others.
<!--l. 503--><p class="indent" >   Reputation is easily measured by one of several online social networks. Your actions are rewarded or punished by
those with whom you interact, who can ping your Rep score with positive or negative feedback. These networks are
used by all of the factions, as reputation can affect your social activities in capitalist economies as well. The primary
reputation networks include:

<!--l. 515--><p class="indent" >   Reputation is rated from 0-99. Depending on your background and faction, you may start with a Rep score in
one or more networks. This can be bolstered through spending customization points during character creation.

and electronics. You buy gear for your character with customization points during character creation (see p. 136)
and in the game with Credit or Rep. Certain restricted, illegal, or hard-to-find items may require special efforts to
obtain (see Acquiring Gear, p. 298). If you have access to a nanofabricator, you may be able to simply build gear,
presuming you have the proper blueprints (see Nanofabrication, p. 284). For a complete listing of equipment options,
see the Gear chapter, p. 296.
<!--l. 524--><p class="indent" >   Even among the remaining capitalist economies, prices can vary drastically. To represent this, all gear falls into a
cost category. Each category defines a range of costs, so the gamemaster can adjust the prices of individual items as
appropriate to the situation. Each category also lists an average price for that category, which is used during
character generation and any time the gamemaster wants to keep costs simple. See the Gear Costs table on p.
137.
