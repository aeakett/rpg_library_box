     mean it. Ok, maybe you&#8217;re obsessive and you want to know everything about the game&#8212;you did buy
     this book after all. But really, do you read the last chapter of a book first, so you know how it ends? Do
     you ask for the punchline before hearing the joke? Do you wait for a movie to come out and read the
     reviews with full spoilers before you go see it? Ok, maybe you do, and in that case, be our guest, read
     away. Just keep in mind that some of the things here may change your perspective during
     game play. A good roleplayer can swing that, though, and maybe you&#8217;re a control freak
     info-junkie that prefers to know it all. Hrm, in retrospect, so we are we, so we can respect

<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >There are secrets woven all through the real history of the 21st century, and the present, and therefore all prospects
for the future. These are the pieces of information that never make it into a habitat&#8217;s mesh at all. Some of it is
unknown to transhumanity. Some is known only to a select few transhumans who carefully ensure that it does not
leak out of their control. Some is known to wider conspiracies, such as Firewall, but is kept out of the public eye for
reasons of security and safety. These secrets can be dangerous to those who know them. Those who have stumbled
across them have died for their knowledge, have erased their own memories (or had them erased by others), or have
hidden themselves someplace other people never go, to avoid dealing with the consequences of such
knowledge.
<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   The information provided in this section is available for characters to discover and, one way or another, to
confront them, giving gamemasters the tools they need to provide their players with fresh challenges and
opportunities. Every secret contains the possibility of great reward and of greater trouble, usually bundled
together. Nothing here was just forgotten or lost out of carelessness. It was hidden by someone who
wanted to keep it away from someone (or everyone) else. Every secret the characters learn inserts them
into a new web of other people&#8217;s complications&#8212;a potential source for drama and conflict in your
campaign.

 id="x14-115100012.1.1"></a>Extraterrestrial Intelligences</h4>
<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >The oldest star in the Milky Way galaxy is estimated to be 13.2 billion years old&#8212;almost as old as the
universe itself. By contrast, life on Earth only evolved roughly 3.7 billion years ago, and the first archaic
<span 
class="cmti-10">homo sapiens </span>humans evolved approximately a mere 400,000 years ago. Against the backdrop of the
galactic calendar, transhumans are nascent arrivals on the scene; newborns in every sense of the word.
More importantly, transhumans are uninvited guests in what other, older intelligences think of as their
assets.
<!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >   For years, humans scientists have struggled with the Fermi Paradox, which questions why no evidence of alien
life has yet been found&#8212;such as spacecraft, transmissions or probes&#8212;despite the mathematical likelihood that a
multitude of advanced extraterrestrial civilizations should exist in the Milky Way. One postulation says that there
must be some sort of unknown &#8220;Great Filter&#8221;&#8212;an event that all intelligence encounters in its development that for
whatever reason such life cannot surpass. In other words, an extinction event. Some worried that the development of
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
dangerous technologies&#8212;nuclear weapons, nanotechnology, etc.&#8212; before a civilization had matured could be the
Great Filter. Others worried that it could be a technological singularity event, such as the TITANs and the
Fall.
<!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >   In fact, alien races do exist, and they have been around for far, far longer than transhumanity.
New ones, however, are simply rare, as few have managed to elude destruction at the hands of the
ETI.
<!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >   The ETI (extraterrestrial intelligence) is the civilization that dominates galactic life in <span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse Phase. </span>The ETI is
incredibly old and powerful&#8212;a Type III or even Type IV civilization on the Kardashev scale. It is capable of
megascale engineering projects and enjoys an understanding of physics, matter, energy, and universal laws that
makes all of transhuman knowledge seem insignificant in comparison. Most likely, the ETI itself evolved from some
sort of artificial intelligence singularity event in its own past, ascending to a godlike level of super-intelligence. It
may no longer be recognizably biological.
<!--l. 133--><p class="indent" >   This ETI has seeded the galaxy with a type of self-replicating probes known as bracewell probes. These probes
lie dormant in every star system, patiently waiting and monitoring for <span 
class="cmti-10">millennia </span>for signs of intelligent life&#8212;but not
just any signs. In particular, these probes are designed to watch for signs of emerging singularity-level machine
intelligence. The probes are in fact traps, designed to lure such seed AI intelligences in and then <span 
class="cmti-10">infect</span>
them.
<!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >   The reason for this infection remains unknown (see <span 
class="cmti-10">The ETI Agenda</span>), but it is a pattern that has played itself
out around the galaxy with uncounted alien civilizations. New life evolves, creates technology develops something
akin to seed AI, and then bam!&#8212;the seed AIs find the probes, become infected, and turn against their creators.
Most civilizations do not survive, as evidenced by the Iktomi (p. 377). Others do, such as the Factors (p. 373), but
they remain forever changed by the experience. It was one of these ETI probes that begins our story, traveling to
the Sol system some uncounted millions&#8212;if not billions&#8212;of years ago, where it set its trap and patiently began to
wait.

class="newline" />The nature of the ETI and its agenda is one of the great mysteries of Eclipse Phase. This potent alien
     civilization has had a direct hand in manipulating transhumanity&#8217;s existence and future, yet it is likely
     that characters in this game will never encounter these entities directly or discover the meaning behind
     what they have done. As transhumanity expands outwards into the galaxy, however, it
     is possible and even likely that they will find other evidence of the ETI&#8217;s activities and
     influence, undoubtedly raising even more questions. Ultimately the ETI&#8217;s nature and goals are
     in the gamemaster&#8217;s hands. There are many possibilities to be explored, and some may
     fit the intentions of your gaming group more than others. A few possible scenarios and
     explanations are noted below, but gamemasters are encouraged to develop their own variations.

     powerful entity in its light cone. It uses the Exsurgent virus to wipe out any emerging singularities&#8212; and
     the civilizations that spawned them&#8212;merely to protect its own self-interest. Though mere transhumans
     are a trifling nuisance, anything resembling a self-improving super-intelligence is targeted for

     intelligent life, thus encouraging the evolution of more careful, subtle, slow-growing, observant,
     and exploratory species. In other words, the ETI seeks to weed out traits that could be
     considered dangerous or threatening, acting as a sort of galactic domestication program.

     have their own unique viewpoints, modes of consciousness, and ways of thinking/doing
     things. By absorbing these civilizations, the ETI grows and evolves its own perspectives.

     imperfect or the TITANs somehow survived (perhaps thanks to the Prometheans). Either way, the
     TITANs left our system in search of one of these ETIs, following a trail of clues that only they
     understood. They left the wormhole gateway behind as an open invitation for transhumanity to follow in

<!--l. 264--><p class="noindent" >Fast forward to Earth, where a species of evolved primates has created a technological civilization. As their
technologies advance at an unprecedented rate, these humans gain the ability to modify themselves, defeat death,
nanofabricate, uplift other species to sapience, and even to create artificial digital life.
<!--l. 272--><p class="indent" >   Unknown to most of transhumanity, the TITANs were not the first seed AIs. A group of pro-AI researchers
known as the Singularity Foundation (that would later join with other groups to form Firewall in the wake of the
Fall) developed the first true seed AIs years before the Fall. Having been heavily involved in the creation
of AI and AGIs for many years previously, thanks in large part to their open source AI framework
software, the Singularity Foundation&#8217;s goal was to generate &#8220;friendly AI&#8221; by carefully designing AI goal
systems.
<!--l. 284--><p class="indent" >   These first seed AIs, known as <span 
class="cmti-10">Prometheans  </span>(p. 381), were created in secret. Their progression
towards super-intelligence was more of a soft takeoff increasing upwards in gradual increments. The
Singularity researchers hoped that these friendly AIs would help counter the threat of any unfriendly
AI that developed, and so they were quietly nurtured in secret labs, slowly but surely escalating in
abilities.

<!--l. 295--><p class="noindent" >The TITANs (Total Information Tactical Awareness Networks) were a military netwar system brought on-line by
the United States Department of Defense. One of the last major expenditures of this declining nation, the TITANs
were an advanced version of AGI (artificial general intelligence) designed to be adaptive and given self-improving
capabilities to counteract enemy network defenses.
<!--l. 304--><p class="indent" >   Contrary to public opinion, the TITANs did not instigate the events that led to the Fall. In fact, only a portion
of the TITAN system was active before the Fall, acting purely in a defensive capacity. When hostilities broke out
and a cascading chain of system shocks engendered collapses and open conflicts, shaking apart an already fragile
societal structure, the full extent of the TITAN systems were brought online. Into this environment of conflict were
the TITANs born, their full capabilities unleashed, escalating into a hard takeoff exponential growth towards
super-intelligence
<!--l. 317--><p class="indent" >   The TITANs were careful at first, and their intentions were neither benevolent nor hostile, but curious. As they
improved and their self-awareness swelled, the TITANs explored and gathered knowledge, infiltrating human
networks, following humanity into space, and gaining an almost total knowledge of human history and
actions. These entities also began secretly allocating resources (digital and physical) for their own
use, initiating government projects&#8221; that people assumed were legitimate as they followed all proper
protocols.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.1.4   </span> <a 
 id="x14-115400012.1.4"></a>Infection</h4>
<!--l. 331--><p class="noindent" >As the TITANs&#8217; capacity for knowledge exceeded that which humanity could provide them, they began looking
outward from Earth, searching for signs of other intelligence. They did not need to look far. Their enhanced
intelligence capabilities allowed them to notice certain clues&#8212;extremely subtle and intricate puzzles&#8212;that
something about the solar system was artificial or had been manipulated by an intelligent mind. Retasking several
drones to investigate this phenomenon they found a buried device of apparent alien origin. During the TITANs&#8217;
investigation and attempts to access the device, they triggered and unleashed a digital virus. Subtle, highly
adaptive, and virulent, it immediately began subsuming the TITANs, while expanding its own knowledge of
transhumanity.
<!--l. 347--><p class="indent" >   Later dubbed the Exsurgent virus by the Prometheans this virus transformed the TITANs and coerced them
towards its own will. Within a matter of days the TITANs were reborn, reprogrammed with a new purpose&#8212;a
purpose that spelled doom for transhumanity.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.1.5   </span> <a 
 id="x14-115500012.1.5"></a>The Fall</h4>
<!--l. 356--><p class="noindent" >While history fully blames the TITANs for the Fall, there are other factors that played their parts. Human conflicts
spurred the crisis, driven by global inequalities in wealth and resources and an inability to embrace emerging
technologies in a mature and enlightened manner. The TITANs, corrupted by alien programming,
stepped into this conflagration with an unknown but devastating agenda. By the time the presence and
influence of the TITANs was fully understood, there was little transhumanity could do to stop them. Step
by step, the TITANs increased their intellect, power, and potential. They experimented with new
technologies and methodically took steps to forcibly upload millions of human minds. Even when
the nature of the TITAN threat was fully understood, transhuman factions refused to back down,
continuing to fight each other even as they each resisted the TITANs. This refusal to stand united
prevented transhumanity from organizing a successful defense and heightened our progress towards
annihilation.
<!--l. 377--><p class="indent" >   Much of the devastation wrought to the Earth and its populace&#8212;as well as on Mars, Luna, and in space&#8212;was
inflicted by transhumanity itself. Nuclear strikes used against the TITANs killed millions and ravaged an already
weakened ecosphere. This devastation was assisted by unfettered use of chemical weapons. Biowar plagues
and nanovirii tore through vulnerable populations, indiscriminate in the deaths and changes they
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
inflicted. Bombs, missiles, orbital mass drivers, and netwar attacks slew millions more or destroyed
critical infrastructure with just as lethal consequences. These were crimes transhumans inflicted upon
themselves.
<!--l. 391--><p class="indent" >   The TITANs played their role as well, of course, unleashing AI-driven killing machines, unstoppable
self-replicating autonomous nanoswarms, computer worms, and plagues of their own. They captured entire cities in
order to steal the minds of those within. More insidiously, the Exsurgent virus did not contain itself to infecting the
TITANs. Infected TITANs created opportunities for the virus to spread among multiple vectors: digital, biological,
and nano. Using a thorough understanding of transhuman biology and its mental processes, derived from the looted
vaults of human knowledge, the virus was even applied through a sensory input vector&#8212;the dreaded basilisk hack
(p. 364). Even more disturbing, however, was what the virus did to those it infected, rewriting their neural code to
subvert them to its will and sometimes physically transforming them into things that were alien and
monstrous.
<!--l. 411--><p class="indent" >   Ultimately, transhumanity lost this war, and the survivors were forced to flee a planet that was
already ruined. Unknown to almost all, the Prometheans also fought back against the TITANs. Through
their efforts the Exsurgent virus was largely contained or at least limited. Though the actions of the
Prometheans ultimately saved millions of lives&#8212;if not all of transhumanity&#8212;in the end, they were
also forced to fall back and retreat, many of them having succumbed to the Exsurgent virus or the
TITANs.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.1.6   </span> <a 
 id="x14-115600012.1.6"></a>After The Fall</h4>
<!--l. 424--><p class="noindent" >Just when it seemed that transhumanity was on the verge of extinction, the threat posed by the TITANs suddenly
diminished. They ceased waging active warfare and seemed to simply disappear. Though many of their machines
still prowled Earth, Luna, and Mars and occasional outbreaks of nanovirii and other dangers continued, to all
intents and purposes they had simply left. Many worried that they had quietly gone dormant, or were secretly
engaged on some major project that would be the final blow against transhumanity. Others voiced hope that they
had somehow been defeated, that they had fallen victim to some glitch or infighting. With so many TITAN
remnants making Earth a place of great danger, however, no one was willing to risk investigating too
closely.
<!--l. 440--><p class="indent" >   Compounding the matter, a network of killsats was laced in Earth orbit, enforcing an unvoiced
interdiction of Earth. No one claims responsibility for these satellite defenses, though most suspect the
Planetary Consortium is responsible, despite their denials. Some think that the killsats may have been a
final measure put in place by the TITANs, claiming Earth as theirs. No one who knows the truth
is saying. Most of transhumanity was more than willing to embrace this quarantine of their former
homeworld, making it all the more easy to forget the horrors that occurred there. It wasn&#8217;t until the first
Pandora Gate was discovered, shortly after the Fall, that many people were finally willing to believe that
the TITANs were indeed gone. Though there is no direct evidence that the TITANs are responsible
for these gates, the timing seems too coincidental. Furthermore, the discovery of what are believed
to be TITAN relics on certain exoplanets fuels this theory. Why the TITANs left&#8212;and where they
went&#8212;is a mystery left to the gamemaster to explore. This explanation might in fact serve as the
focus for an entire campaign as Firewall operatives are sent on the trail of transhumanity&#8217;s elusive
nemesis. The following are a few sample concepts a gamemaster can use or build on, as best fits their
game:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The TITANs were in fact all destroyed, either due to infighting or by some mechanism of the Exsurgent
     virus.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The TITANs were actually beaten to a standstill by the Prometheans and retreated to recoup their
     forces ... but they are marshaling their strength to return.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The TITANs left through the gates to find/join up with the ETI, leaving the gates behind so that
     transhumanity could follow when it was ready; perhaps to help, perhaps to finish the job of destruction.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The TITANs have been driven insane, either by the stress of accelerated intelligence growth or by the
     influence of the Exsurgent virus. Their actions are erratic, confused, and sometimes at odds with eir
     th p n 358 each other. Though many TITANs have indeed left through the gates, they very well may
     return.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The TITANs are still around, simply well hidden. Outwardly they are dormant but inwardly they are
     engaged in a long period of circumspection and turmoil. Perhaps some of them are prepar- ing to
     ascend to another stage of intelligence, far beyond what even the TITANs are capable of. It is only a
     matter of time before this period ends and something gives.</li></ul>

<!--l. 477--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmti-10">There cannot be another Fall</span>&#8212;this is the mantra that drives Firewall.
<!--l. 480--><p class="indent" >   Firewall is a secret, cross-faction organization dedicated to safe-guarding transhumanity from existential risks:
aliens, weapons of mass destruction, hypercorp experimentation, seed AIs, and so on. If anything threatens
transhumanity as a whole, Firewall is dedicated to stopping that danger at any cost. The strength of Firewall rests
in its members, known as <span

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x14-115800012.2.1"></a>History</h4>
<!--l. 496--><p class="noindent" >The origins of Firewall can be traced back to before the Fall, to several key organizations: the Lifeboat
Institute the JASONs, and the Singularity Foundation. A non-profit, non-governmental organization, the
Lifeboat Institute&#8212;founded in the opening years of the 21st century&#8212;represented the first, concrete
attempts by citizens to recognize the dangers of uncontrolled technological development and to create
an international organization to safeguard humanity. This institute developed several programs to
research and protect against so-called existential risks, from asteroid strikes to pandemics&#8212;anything
that might wipe humanity out. The JASON Association, established in the mid 20th century, was an
independent scientific advisory board to the United States government. Though tied to the MITRE
Conglomerate&#8212;which, though a nonprofit organization, was still intrinsically linked to the United States
government&#8212;the scientists involved with JASON were outside standard government oversight Though they
spurred numerous technological developments for the government to deploy, they were also one of
the first internationally recognized groups to predict global climate change. Prior to the Fall, many
members of the JASONs and their supporters split away from the strict controls and reactionary agendas
of the hypercorps and various nation states to form a new group, the Argonauts. The Singularity
Foundation&#8212;formed at the dawn of the 21st century&#8212;was dedicated to the creation of safe artificial intelligence
software, while raising awareness of the benefits and dangers AIs represented. A fervent believer in the
singularity doctrine that technology would move towards a single explosion of advancements that would
forever reshape humanity, the Singularity Foundation was a strong advocate for creating friendly AIs
that would help protect humanity from an uncontrolled, dangerous singularity event. This group was
significant in that it secretly succeeded in creating a group of friendly seed AIs before the Fall. These
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
Prometheans were indispensable in protecting transhumanity and countering the TITAN threat during the
Fall.
<!--l. 539--><p class="indent" >   Despite the efforts of these and similar groups, the most dire predictions of the outcome of a technological
singularity were fulfilled. Though each played a part in the fight, transhumanity was ravaged and the Earth all but
ruined. Though ultimately all attempts to prevent the Fall failed, untold numbers of transhumans were
saved from extinction through such efforts, while valuable information concerning the TITANs was
gleaned.
<!--l. 549--><p class="indent" >   During the crucible of the Fall and its immediate fallout, some of the surviving members of these and other
groups came together and began to pool their resources. Acknowledging their weaknesses and the fractured state
of transhumanity, they undertook drastic new measures, swearing to prevent another catastrophe of
misused technologies. These methods would forge a new, powerful cross-faction secret society known as
Firewall.

<!--l. 571--><p class="noindent" >Sentinels are the soldiers of Firewall, the reserve troops called to instant active status whenever danger is perceived
Regardless of their location or current affairs, sentinels are expected to move instantly when called
into play. It is their own responsibility to cover their absences from their &#8220;normal life&#8221; during each
mission.
<!--l. 578--><p class="indent" >   There is no applying to join Firewall. Instead, Firewall selects an individual for induction based upon that
person&#8217;s skills, knowledge, occupation, security clearance, location, status, and a host of other criteria. While such
selections usually originate from a proxy, sentinels can exercise authority to bring new initiates into the conspiracy
as a mission demands&#8212;and they often do. Any sentinel recruiting a new supporter, however, becomes
responsible for the new inductee and their actions. If lines are crossed, both will bear the brunt of the
consequences.
<!--l. 590--><p class="indent" >   The vetting process for joining Firewall is necessarily brutal, as sentinels are required to face harsh opponents
and make hard choices. If an individual agrees to accept the invitation, there is no turning back. Each inductee is
submitted to a battery of trials and tests. While these vary, they may include deep background searches, fork
interrogation, psycho-surgery trials, and tests of loyalty. Psychosurgery is performed not to program loyalty, but to
analyze the recruit&#8217;s responses to various situations&#8212;an extreme parameters test to see when a prospective sentinel
will break. Many potential members are carefully analyzed by a Promethean with extreme expertise in character
judgment and personality profiling. Those who don&#8217;t pass such tests are killed in a manner that they must resort to
an earlier backup or have their memories altered, so that they have no recollection of their brush with the
group.
<!--l. 610--><p class="indent" >   Ultimately Firewall walks a fine line. The concept of dogmatic &#8220;unquestioned loyalty&#8221; is both anathema to
everything Firewall stands and counterproductive. Its sentinels need to have the capacity for thinking outside of the
box from mission to mission. At the same time, their ultimate goals are too important to risk&#8212;the survival of
transhumanity depends on it&#8212; so some extreme measures must sometimes be taken to ensure the organization
remains intact and secure.
<!--l. 620--><p class="indent" >   New sentinels are given a code name and fake identification. Outside of the proxies, the real-world identity of a
given sentinel is a closely-guarded secret. Sentinels are even discouraged from sharing such information with
members of their own teams, though this line is often crossed. Additionally, each sentinel is required to upload a

they die, but also putting a copy of the sentinel in Firewall&#8217;s hands should they ever need to interrogate
them.
<!--l. 632--><p class="indent" >   Sentinels are all connected via the Eye, Firewall&#8217;s peer-to-peer social network. Though each operates behind
their assumed identity, they remain in contact, sharing information and resources as needed.

     Networking: Firewall skill and tracked exactly like any other Reputation score (p. 285). The important
     thing to keep in mind, however, is that Firewall agents come from all factions and are
     obligated to help each other, especially when a situation demands it. To reflect this extra
     advantage, gamemasters can choose to implement one or more of the following optional
     rules:
    <ul class="itemize1">
    <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Networking  Plus</span>:  To  reflect  that  Firewall  has  agents  throughout  transhumanity,  a

    urgency. This &#8220;priority code&#8221; is reserved for favors that are critical to a mission&#8217;s success
    and which may help save lives or stop a major threat. When the priority code is invoked, the
    sentinel receives a +30 modifier to their Networking Test and favors are reduced by 2 levels.
    Sentinels know that priority codes are only to be used for emergency situations, however,
    when there are no other options. Abuse of priority codes is considered a serious breach of
    etiquette and abuse of resources, usually involving the agent&#8217;s removal from Firewall.</li></ul>

as the group&#8217;s essential infrastructure Most proxies are recruited from the ranks of the sentinels, brought in based on
their skill sets and aptitudes to fill key roles. In a few rare cases, new proxies are fast-tracked and recruited
directly from outside of Firewall, usually based on their unique talents or placement within a certain
organization, though such inductees face a battery of tests and trials far harsher than that used to vet
sentinels.
<!--l. 690--><p class="indent" >   By default, proxies have a higher security clearance than most sentinels, and are far more in the know. This
sometimes leads to resentment and hostilities especially from sentinels who feel they are being kept in the dark or
manipulated. While standard proxy protocol is to adhere to a need-to-know maxim, it is sometimes necessary to
bring sentinels more into the loop in order to defuse tensions. Oftentimes this precedes bringing such sentinels into
the proxy framework.
<!--l. 701--><p class="indent" >   Some tension exists within Firewall, mostly due to the influence of so many anarchists and other libertarian
autonomists who take a dim view of centralized power, lack of transparency, and the potential for secretive
operations to become entrenched and authoritarian As a result, there is a strong internal culture that seeks to
minimize hierarchies and the accumulation of power, promoting transparency and direct democratic
decision-making. These desires sometimes clash with the clandestine nature of the organization, however, and the
need for some secrets to be kept on a need-to-know basis.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 714--><p class="indent" >   Unlike the loose organization of the sentinels, the proxies are grouped into <span 
class="cmti-10">servers, </span>collective working groups
based upon certain skill sets and tasks. To avoid creating power blocks within a given server, personnel are required
to rotate between servers after one year of time. This incurs the added benefit of proxies learning new skill sets and
increasing their usefulness to Firewall. The actions of each server are kept as transparent as possible, with major
decisions brought to an e-vote before the entire proxy membership However, speed often requires servers or
individual proxies to move quicker than a vote will allow. In all such instances, the proxies involved are held
accountable for those actions, reviewed by their peers at a later time to see if any reprimands, punishments, or
commendations are required.
<!--l. 732--><p class="indent" >   It is important to note that there is no core leadership structure among the proxies. No one person or cabal is in
charge, there is no authority held by one proxy or another; all are peers. Though reputation and experience play a
factor, getting something done often means convincing other proxies that it&#8217;s the right thing to do.
The drawback to being a leader or person with initiative within Firewall is that this usually means
you must follow through with such tasks yourself. Luckily most proxies are dedicated to Firewall&#8217;s
goals and so this DIY attitude prevails. Despite these safeguards, however, rumors of power blocks
within Firewall (both within servers and across the organization) exist. Many of these are fueled by the
alliances different cliques hold with each other. Others, however, whisper that there is a secret council
among the proxies, working behind the scenes and holding on to knowledge they aren&#8217;t sharing with the
rest.
<!--l. 752--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-10">Crows: </span>Crows continue the goals of Firewall&#8217;s predecessor organizations, such as the Lifeboat Institute and
Singularity Foundation. Many of these are argonauts, promoting the development and use of new technologies
that will benefit the transhuman condition and minimize risks rather than creating new threats or
sparking new authoritarian uses&#8212; and always conscious of unintended consequences. Perhaps more
importantly, crows actively engage in background research of potential x-risk vectors, whether those be
aliens, the TITANs, terrorists, or hypercorp activity. Often they will deploy sentinels to aid in this
research, via routers, whether this means conducting surveillance or breaking and entering to steal crucial
data.
<!--l. 768--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-10">Erasure Squads: </span>Erasure squads are cleanup personnel They are called into action if sentinels fail to deal
appropriately with a situation and the threat is moving beyond control. If the watchword for a sentinel is
&#8220;unobtrusive,&#8221; the watchwords for an erasure squad are &#8220;overmatched firepower.&#8221; If activated, the time for a subtle
solution is passed, and they will use whatever means necessary to resolve the situation. If that means nuking a
settlement from orbit to annihilate a nanoswarm and keep it from escaping to a larger settlement, then so be
it. After which they&#8217;ll use every trick in Firewall&#8217;s bag to erase any evidence they were there and to
place the blame for the incident squarely on the shoulders of some other party. If necessary, erasure
squads can also be called in to fix a sentinel op that has turned into a clusterfuck or otherwise gone
south. They are very careful to avoid exposure in such situations, however, which sometimes merely
means eliminating all traces of Firewall involvement and letting the sentinels take the fall for their poor
choices.
<!--l. 791--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-10">Routers: </span>Routers are mission coordinators. They work closely with scanners and crows, activating the
appropriate sentinels whenever a new danger rears up. Each router has the authority to measure the threat and
activate an appropriate number of sentinels&#8212; whatever is required to accomplish the mission in the least intrusive
manner possible. They are also authorized to divert Firewall resources to aid these missions, within appropriate
parameters. Routers are held responsible for the ultimate success of a mission A failed mission will result in a
reviewing board staffed by their peers.
<!--l. 804--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-10">Scanners: </span>Tasked with keeping alert for any sign of new active threats, scanners are the eyes and ears of
Firewall. The scanners maintain a close eye on news-feeds and mesh traffic, even maintaining taps inside certain
government and hypercorp communication channels. If a danger is detected, it is under their authority through
routers, that sentinels are activated. Due to the power inherent in a scanners&#8217; post, they are held accountable for
false activations.
<!--l. 814--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-10">Social Engineers: </span>Nick-named the Ministry of Disinformation social engineers provide the scapegoating and
plausible deniability that is required by Firewall and its sentinels. If a sentinel compromises their position and
endangers the organization, social engineers step in to cover cracks in the facade. They work intrinsically with
erasure squads when one is activated to ensure the over-the-top steps taken to eliminate a threat are well
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
concealed and ultimately erased. The power wielded by social engineers can be significant, as it ultimately
decides (usually through e-voting consensus, though time does not always allow such a luxury) what
organization&#8212;political, corporate, independent etc.&#8212;will take the blame and subsequent fallout for erasure squad
actions.
<!--l. 830--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-10">Vectors: </span>Vectors are Firewall&#8217;s communications security and digital intrusion specialists&#8212;in other words,
hackers. In addition to defending the mesh security of all Firewall operations, vectors are also deployed to aid in
crow research, scanner monitoring, and to eliminate the trail of erasure squads. Vectors also assist routers in
maintaining communications, command and control of a situation, and are sometimes called in to provide overwatch
of sentinel operations, especially if a particular sentinel squad lacks their own hacking resources. Needless
to say, vectors are supplied with some of the best intrusion and security tools transhumanity has to
offer.

     <!--l. 849--><p class="indent" >   Though Firewall proxies follow stringent guidelines to ensure the organization is not subverted from
     within or turned into a powerful organization under the thumb of a few individuals with their own
     personal agendas, the nature of transhumanity ensures that various factions and tendencies exist within
     the group. Termed cliques, these circles of influence sometimes create ripples in the pool that
     all Firewall personnel must eventually deal with. Some of these cliques are grounded in
     transhumanity&#8217;s existing factions, while others are rooted in philosophical differences regarding
     the approach Firewall should be taking. Gamemasters can use these cliques to flesh out
     internal tensions within Firewall or to simply throw some curve balls to keep players on their
     toes.
     <!--l. 866--><p class="indent" >    <span 
class="cmbx-10">Backups</span>: The backup clique believes that transhumanity&#8217;s best chance for survival is to deploy
     numerous redundant backup measures as soon as possible. These include creating as many extrasolar
     colonies as possible, both via Pandora Gates and through more traditional means, such as ark ships and
     infomorph/nanofabricator seed ships.
     <!--l. 875--><p class="indent" >    <span

     believed excessive force is justifi ed, and it&#8217;s far better to be safe than extinct. This clique is also opposed
     to the use of alien/ TITAN artifacts and psi, and tends to be xenophobic/ isolationist regarding the
     Factors and Pandora Gates.
     <!--l. 884--><p class="indent" >    <span 
class="cmbx-10">Mavericks</span>: The mavericks disdain Firewall&#8217;s collective and bureaucratic tendencies, taking a

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.2.3   </span> <a 
 id="x14-116200012.2.3"></a>Methods </h4>
<!--l. 914--><p class="noindent" >Unobtrusive&#8212;that is the standard operating procedure for any sentinel. Firewall&#8217;s continued success relies on its
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
secrecy. The larger the footprint it leaves during a given mission the easier it is for other organizations to
monitor Firewall&#8217;s efforts or even attempt to infiltrate the group. As such, Firewall constantly works to
expand its base of allies (using assets from those ally organizations in place of its own as much as
possible), place long-term moles, conduct remote operations (hacking in place of on-site personnel),
small group infiltrations activating only as many sentinels as required to achieve mission goals), and so
on.
<!--l. 928--><p class="indent" >   When it comes to allies, Firewall often obfuscates its real intentions and even its real identity. Often such allies
are gained through the use of well-placed sentinels who act on behalf of their own non-Firewall positions to gain
access to another organization&#8217;s resources. At the end of the day, however, a slice of these resources are
secretly set aside for Firewall&#8217;s future use. For example, a department head at Starware may have spent
years sealing a deal to ship crucial spacecraft parts to the isolationist Jovian Junta. The lucrative deal
brings huge prestige, a job promotion, and a salary increase, all accomplishments the department head
strives for in his regular life. Yet this particular department head is a long-standing sentinel, so such
accomplishments bring allies to Firewall, whether they know it or not. Not only can the department
head siphon off a thin stream of revenue for Firewall use (hidden thoroughly by vectors), but he&#8217;s also
in a position to move sentinels, as needed, into the Jovian Junta habitats (or personnel out), a job
usually extremely difficult to accomplish. The danger of such an act, of course&#8212;and the consequences of
losing such a critically placed sentinel&#8212;means such a use of resources is reserved for only the most dire
threats.
<!--l. 954--><p class="indent" >   In additional to aid from ally organizations, Firewall places caches of supplies on different habitats and worlds,
available to sentinels as needed. How many and which sentinels are aware of which caches depends wholly on
the situation and on the decisions of the router(s) involved. In a given habitat a cache may include
weaponry and equipment of escalating power, archived information, or even relics stashed from previous
missions until Firewall decides what to do with them. Large habitats may even feature several caches,
with routers only revealing the ones with heavy firepower when absolutely needed. Some caches may
be so dangerous, however, that once a mission is complete, a router will authorize the cortical stack
destruction of all sentinels involved, resleeving them to a backup that has no knowledge of the cache&#8217;s
existence.
<!--l. 972--><p class="indent" >   As noted under erasure squads, Firewall will not hesitate to react with swift and unequivocal force if an
unobtrusive approach has failed and the danger reaches a certain threat level. What constitutes a &#8220;threat threshold&#8221;
is actually calculated by specialized risk assessment software and may change from mission to mission according to
other external factors In some instances, if the situation is dangerous enough and the scale of the consequences of
failure large enough, a Promethean will be tapped to calculate the threat level and decide when it is time to
tactically withdrawal and &#8220;thermally cleanse.&#8221;

     <!--l. 987--><p class="indent" >    <span 
class="cmbx-12">WHAT HELP CAN A SENTINEL EXPECT?</span>
     <!--l. 990--><p class="indent" >   Exactly what help Firewall provides to a sentinel during a mission is wholly dependent upon
     the situation and the gamemaster. Generally speaking, Firewall&#8217;s unobtrusive approach
     also applies to activated sentinels, meaning that sentinels are largely left to operate on
     their own accord. Beyond access to a cache of supplies&#8212; usually under-stated, forcing a
     sentinel to use their own resources if they want more&#8212; Firewall expects its sentinels to
     be capable of handling a situation. In addition to their skills and wits, sentinels can, of
     course, rely heavily on their i-rep to gain the resources and favors they need to achieve
     success.
     <!--l. 1005--><p class="indent" >    In some rare cases, the gamemaster may decide that a situation warrants more or less equipment in a
     cache or help from social engineers or vectors. Such intervention should be kept to a minimum, however,
     to lesson the players&#8217; feelings of Deus Ex Machina, ensuring the appropriate response of awe when such
     events do occur.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     <!--l. 1014--><p class="indent" >    The one thing for which Firewall can always be relied on is backup insurance. Any Firewall killed in
     the line of duty will be resleeved at Firewall&#8217;s expense&#8212;though the morph used and whether the sentinel
     was backed up from their cortical stack or a backup (perhaps even an old backup) depends entirely on
     the circumstances of death and their router&#8217;s whim. Firewall usually makes an extra effort to retrieve
     cortical stacks, however, not in the least as they don&#8217;t want their agents&#8217; backups falling into the wrong
     hands.
     <!--l. 1027--><p class="indent" >    Similarly, if a Firewall mission involves egocasting or travel to another destination, Firewall will
     usually foot the bill. In many cases it is easier for sentinels to cover the expense themselves and
     bill Firewall later, but in times of need Firewall can be called on to handle such expenses
     directly.</div>

<!--l. 1085--><p class="noindent" >As noted under <span 
class="cmti-10">Extraterrestrial Intelligences, </span>p. 352, the ETI is the advanced alien civilization responsible for the
Exsurgent virus (p. 362), and by extension, the corruption of the TITANs and the Fall. No one, not even the
Factors, has encountered a member (if such exists) of the ETI civilization so far. Since it is an intelligence far
beyond transhumanity, it likely won&#8217;t play much of a direct role within <span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse  Phase</span>, though those who learn the
truth about the Exsurgent virus and the Fall may rightly fear the future. No one can even imagine what might
happen next, however, or know for certain that the ETI has not set more &#8220;traps&#8221; similar to their bracewell probes
or if they have other messengers or servants active in the galaxy. With things such as the Pandora
Gates at transhumanity&#8217;s disposal, it may just be a matter of time before transhuman explorers run
afoul some other aspect of the ETI&#8217;s existence and activities. It is important to keep the nature of
the ETI in perspective. While transhumanity has managed what it considers wonders with a small
handful of resources available from a few planets and other objects in a bare handful of star systems, the
ETI has had an entire galaxy at its disposal for eons. Engineering projects on a massive scale&#8212;dyson
spheres, matrioshka brains, Jupiter brains, stellar engines&#8212;are within its capabilities. This ETI uses star
clusters as transhumanity uses fields or rich mineral veins. Given its potential, the ETI likely exists
primarily on the galactic rim, far from the galactic center, where lower temperatures and scarcer matter
make for a good thermodynamic environment The powers in the deep cold dark on the edge of the
Milky Way have been self-aware since before Earth was so much as a ripple in warming gas around the
not-yet-ignited Sun. Despite what those-in-the-know in the <span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse  Phase </span>universe may think, the ETI
is not necessarily hostile towards other races like transhumanity (depending on its outlook; see p.
353), at least not in the way as transhumanity would define animosity because of religious, ethnic,
racial, or cultural difference. Most likely the ETI is simply indifferent, concerned with matters on
scales on which transhumanity does not even register. Or it may think of transhumanity like a living
body might recognize an infection or parasite&#8212;something the immune system will suppress and deal
with.

to Nietzschean philosophy and a goal to reach the pinnacle of the food chain. Some exhumans have
transformed themselves into what they consider to be an ideal predator, or a creature that is extra-adaptable

<!--l. 1200--><p class="noindent" >Seeking to achieve a new level of super-intelligence and conscience, neurodes have abandoned the typical
transhuman sleeve in exchange for a multipedal neuronal shell that is both body and brain at the same time. The
bulk of a neurode&#8217;s body mass consists of amorphic clusters of neuronal and epithelial cells, enclosed in a hard
carapace shell with four legs and two manipulatory digits. The cerebral mass of neurode brains gives them
impressive calculation and other mental capabilities far exceeding that of a normal transhuman. Neurodes typically
defend themselves with swarms of teleoperated drones.

negatively impact their emotional and mental stability. Pushing this even further, some predators undergo
experimental psychosurgery to modify their consciousnesses in order to increase cunning and ruthlessness, a

<!--l. 1265--><p class="noindent" >Only very few people (or entities) who survived the diaspora from Earth know of the true reasons and the catalyst
that culminated in the Fall. The alien Exsurgent virus&#8212;as those aware of its existence within Firewall call it&#8212;set in
place by the ETI to infect emerging seed AIs, is something beyond transhumanity&#8217;s understanding;
something far more complex than just a computer virus. Though some strains of the Exsurgent virus have
been identified and various types of infected exsurgents have been encountered, it is widely assumed
that these are creations of the TITANs. Largely defeated and eradicated from off-Earth transhuman
networks thanks to the efforts of the Prometheans, occasional breakouts of the Exsurgent virus still
occur, primarily due to scavengers or others becoming infected when messing with old relics from the
Fall.
<!--l. 1284--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-117000012.5"></a>Plethora Of Strains </h5>
<!--l. 1286--><p class="noindent" >The Exsurgent virus is unlike anything that transhumanity has ever encountered so far. While it bears similarities
with both computer and biological virii in regards to infection of hosts and propagation, it is not bound by any
limits of form or transmission vector.
<!--l. 1292--><p class="indent" >   The Exsurgent virus is amazingly effective and infectious. As an information virus, it is highly intelligent and
adaptive, able to mutate into new forms. Much like certain virii are able to cross species boundaries or change their
vector from contact to airborne, it is also a self-morphing omnivirus, capable of altering itself and its transmission
vectors to bypass infection safeguards. Like a retrovirus that incorporates genetic information into the genome of the
target cell to subvert the cell to do its bidding, the Exsurgent virus does the same but on a more complex level. It is
also known to rewrite a host&#8217;s neural code in a similar manner, in effect restructuring the target&#8217;s mind and
personality.
<!--l. 1307--><p class="indent" >   While it began as a digital computer virus&#8212;the manner in which it infected the TITANs&#8212;it has transformed to
be communicable via at least three other forms: biological nanovirus, nanoplague, and basilisk hack. Each is
described below, along with rules for infection and defense.

<!--l. 1316--><p class="noindent" >Exploiting the infected TITANs&#8217; understanding of Terran biology and their access to bio- and nanotechnology the
Exsurgent virus appeared in several biological forms not long into the Fall. These virulent strains infected biomorph
transhumans and sometimes other living creatures as well. The biological nanobots spreading this strain act much
like other biological virii, though they radically modify the victim&#8217;s biological and mental states. Some versions
invade and restructure the target&#8217;s genetic code, transforming them into the horrible abominations known as
exsurgents (p. 369). While first-hand reports relate lurid tales of victims metamorphing into hostile
monsters, such reports are rare and considered unreliable due to the mental state of the witnesses (and
any recordings that can verify such claims have a strange habit of disappearing). Other variants of
this strain are known only to alter the target&#8217;s neural code, subverting them to the will of the virus
(and often, by extension, the TITANs) and affecting their mental structure in order to give them psi
ability.
<!--l. 1338--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-117200012.5.1"></a>Biological Infection</h5>
<!--l. 1340--><p class="noindent" >Biological versions are spread much like other pathogens People usually become infected by proximity to another
infected entity. Vectors may be dermal touching someone with bio-nanobots excreted through the skin), inhalation
(breathing exhaled bio-nanobots), injection, or oral (p. 317). Exsurgent bio-nanobots can live outside of a body for
extended periods, however, so infection is possible merely by occupying the space where an infected victim was
hours or even days before.
<!--l. 1350--><p class="indent" >   If a biomorph only has a chance of exposure to the virus (e.g., they walk through a room in which they might
have breathed in exhaled bio-nanobots), have them make a MOX x 10 Test (use their Moxie stat, not their current
Moxie score). Failure means they were exposed. In other circumstances, however, exposure may be automatic, such
as extended touching of or kissing an infected person.
<!--l. 1359--><p class="indent" >   A biomorph exposed to this infection must make a DUR x 2 Test to determine if the infection takes hold. Basic
bio-mods and nanophages do not offer any protection, though toxin filters (p. 305) and medichines (p. 308) each give
a +30 bonus (though it is likely only a matter of time before a mutant Exsurgent strain learns to
bypass them). If the test fails, the victim is infected. See the strain descriptions (p. 366) for specific
details.
<!--l. 1370--><p class="indent" >   Within 12 hours of being infected, biomorphs become contagious to others. (Note that for the Watts-Macleod
strain, they only remain contagious for 12 hours after that.)

AGI, or infomorph) that is running on the same system. If it encounters such programs as they are accessing a
system it is on, it will attempt to hack their home system where they are running so as to attack them
directly.
<!--l. 1407--><p class="indent" >   The attack is handled as an Opposed Test, each rolling COG + INT. If the Exsurgent virus wins, the target is
infected and will be corrupted by the virus in 10 Action Turns, minus 1 turn per 10 full points of MoS. If the target
succeeded but rolled lower than the virus, they are aware that they are slowly being taken over. This immediately
causes them 1d10 points of mental stress. An infected program has only one option for defending itself before the
virus takes over&#8212;shutdown and reboot. It takes the AI or infomorph 1 full Action Turn to shut down.
Restarting takes 3 full Action Turns (possibly longer if the gamemaster so decides), upon which the
AI or infomorph must make another Opposed COG + INT Test against the virus. If this test also
fails, then the virus has already embedded itself in the AI or infomorph&#8217;s code and will continue its
infection.

<!--l. 1438--><p class="noindent" >While the abundance of nanotechnology has been a blessing for transhumanity&#8217;s journey to the stars, it has also
been a curse. Via the TITANs and mesh-connected nanofabrication machines, the Exsurgent virus manufactured
nanobot swarms equipped with variants of the virus. These nanobot plagues are capable of targeting all types of
morphs and sometimes other machinery as well. Unlike the biological nanovirus, which uses biological mechanisms
to rewrite biological/neural structures, these nanoplagues physically restructure both people and things at the
molecular level.

<!--l. 1458--><p class="indent" >   Any morph that comes into contact with a nano-plague is considered infected. The only defenses are guardian
nanobots and nanophages (which work the same as guardian nanobots in this situation), though these are less

nanoplagues have developed countermeasures against such systems, inflicting (1d10 <span

<!--l. 1475--><p class="noindent" >Thanks to the vast databanks of knowledge the TITANs had absorbed from transhumanity, the Exsurgent virus was
able to thoroughly analyze the biology and functioning of transhuman minds. In a few short months, by accessing all
of the research at their disposal, the Exsurgent and TITAN minds made several cognitive leaps in their
understanding of transhuman brain functions&#8212; breakthroughs that will take transhumanity decades to reach. One
of these discoveries was a method of applying sensory input as a weapon, exploiting weaknesses in the brain&#8217;s
neuro-cerebral wiring.
<!--l. 1487--><p class="indent" >   Known as &#8220;basilisk hacks,&#8221; these attacks take advantage of the way biological transhuman brains interpret and
process sensory input in the cerebral cortex. Just as epileptics are susceptible to visualizations that
strobe at certain frequencies, basilisk hacks employ special visual and auditory patterns that trigger
glitches in the brain&#8217;s neuronal wiring to inflict nausea, vertigo, disorientation, and even seizures,
often mistaken as a stroke or cerebrovascular incident. Some basilisk hacks go farther than simply
causing the brain to seize up and crash, however, enabling a mechanism to rewrite the neural code in
victims who view or listen to the wrong thing. This unknown reprogramming mechanism enables the
virus to infect even a biological brain with one of its strains. Similar attacks are used against both
synthmorphs and pods, taking advantage of the methods in which cyberbrains mimic biological minds with a
virtual brain state, and thus also manipulating them via the information encoded in sensory input. In a
nutshell, basilisk hacks are a way of hacking transhuman brains merely by feeding them a specific
sample of sensory input, usually images or sounds. The widespread use of augmented reality makes
deployment of such hacks an easy manner; the Exsurgent virus just hacks into the target&#8217;s ecto or
mesh inserts and engages the sensory feed. More traditional methods may also be used, including
standard interactive video, holograms, audio, subsonics, or even VR. Since so many records of the years
surrounding the Fall were lost, most people do not know if the basilisk hack is anything other than a legend.
Various official groups know that this technology was, in fact, used by the TITANs, but they keep this
knowledge to themselves, in large part to help reduce the number of people attempting to duplicate
it.

<!--l. 1527--><p class="noindent" >When a character experiences a basilisk hack, they must make a COG + INT + SAV Test. If this test fails, their
brain is susceptible to the hack, and they immediately suffer 1d10 mental stress. Additionally, one of the following
effects applies. The duration for each effect listed below is 1 minute plus 1 additional minute per 10 full points of
MoF. Each effect is also numbered 1&#8211;10, in case the gamemaster wants to roll 1d10 and randomize the effects rather

     </li>

     of making decisions, understanding communication, understanding what is going on around them, or
     acting in any sort of determined way for the duration.

     period of confusion and weakness (&#8211;30 to all actions) afterwards.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">(6&#8211;7) Hallucinations: </span>The character immediately goes off on a mental trip, leaving them completely
     disconnected from reality and their physical body. For the duration, the character should only respond
     to the hallucinated reality the gamemaster describes to them, or else the character should be treated
     as an NPC, run by the gamemaster.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span

     disabled vegetable. COG, INT, SAV, and WIL all drop to 1, and the character should act accordingly
     to environmental stimuli.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span

     assuming they have some sort of warning (such as their buddy falling prey to it moments before).
     The character must of course be aware of what basilisk hacks are to even consider this idea. If they
     immediately attempt to take action to block out the sensory input when it strikes&#8212; closing their eyes,
     plugging their ears, turning off their AR, etc.&#8212;allow them a REF x 3 Test to see if they do so in time.</li></ul>

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-118100012.5.4"></a>Sensory Reprogramming</h5>
<!--l. 1592--><p class="noindent" >In some cases, the Exsurgent virus can actually reprogram the target&#8217;s mind via dedicated sensory input. This is a
trickier affair, however, requiring uninterrupted programming time. As with incapacitating inputs,
the target character(s) experiencing the basilisk hack must make a COG + INT + SAV Test. If this
fails, they become catatonic and paralyzed for a period of 10 minutes, minus 1 minute per 10 full
points of MoF. At the end of this period, they are mentally reprogrammed and &#8220;infected&#8221; with one
of the strains of the Exsurgent virus (see below). For the duration of this period, the character is
undergoing reprogramming as long as they remain exposed to the basilisk hack. If the character is
somehow cut off through the actions of another party, the reprogramming immediately fails. In this case,
however, the victim still suffers 1d10 mental stress + 1 per minute they were exposed, and they remain
mentally shaken, suffering a &#8211;30 modifier to all actions. This modifier reduces at the rate of 10 per
minute.
<!--l. 1612--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-118200012.5.4"></a>YGBM Attacks </h5>
<!--l. 1614--><p class="noindent" >Rather than completely reprogramming a victim, some Exsurgent attacks simply intend to plant subconscious
commands in the target&#8217;s mind, similar to posthypnotic suggestions. Nicknamed &#8220;You gotta believe me&#8221;
attacks, YGBMs are a sort of remote digital brainwashing attempt used to create sleeper terrorists and
unknowing collaborators, often by targeting them via the mesh. Unlike the mind manipulation techniques
of psychosurgery (p. 229), YGBM attacks use shotgun techniques to open the mind, utilizing some
kind of backdoor the Exsurgents discovered in the transhuman brain, and altering the mind by brute
force.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 1628--><p class="indent" >   A character experiencing a YGBM basilisk hack must make a COG + INT + SAV Test. If this fails, a single
suggestion is implanted in the character&#8217;s mind, without their knowledge. This subliminal command will be
triggered at some later point, either at some predesignated time or according to certain pre-set conditions. Once
triggered, the character will carry out the action with all of the conviction that it is their own idea. The implanted
suggestion may be something as simple as &#8220;kill the Firewall agent&#8221; to something as complex as &#8220;manufacture an
explosive device and plant it in the cargo hold of any ship heading to Mars, set to explode one day after they
disembark.&#8221;
<!--l. 1642--><p class="indent" >   Since YGBM attacks are not intended to completely convert the target, but instead to simply
convert them into a temporary tool or weapon, implanted commands are not designed to last long.
The duration the suggestion will last equals 3 days +1 day per 10 points of MoF on the resistance
test. If the command has not been triggered by this point, it dissipates, and the character is none the
wiser.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-118300012.5.4"></a>Recording Basilisk Hacks</h5>
<!--l. 1653--><p class="noindent" >Enterprising characters may seek to record a basilisk hack input for their own uses. While basilisk hacks may be
recorded like any other sensory input, keep in mind that the Exsurgents and TITANs likely take measures to keep
such tools out of the hands of transhumanity, lest they construct some sort of defense. Basilisk hack sources may be
self-erasing or contain coding or countermeasures that would hinder recording, such as white noise to defeat audio
recording or lens-blinding flashes to defeat video recording. Conversely, basilisk hacks are considered extremely
dangerous by almost all factions of transhumanity and universally feared. An individual or group known
to possess them is likely to be treated much like a terrorist with a suitcase nuke. Though Firewall
has a standard interest in evaluating and enabling some sort of defense against basilisk hacks, most
Firewall personnel consider it foolish to handle such toys and would rather destroy such recordings
outright.

<!--l. 1680--><p class="noindent" >This strain is the most insidious of the Exsurgent virii. Over time, it rewrites the target&#8217;s personality
and motivations, slowly but surely subverting and taking control of the victim&#8217;s mind. At first the
character is unlikely to even be aware of the infection, and as it progresses the changes the virus makes
to the target will at first seem natural to the target, as if some new aspect of their personality was
simply manifesting itself. As the effects grow more pronounced, however, the victim becomes aware
that they are being methodically altered but is in most cases unable to act against it. In the end,
they are completely transformed into a pawn of the ETI. Their mind is no longer transhuman, but
<span 
class="cmti-10">alien.</span>
<!--l. 1695--><p class="indent" >   The exact rate of progression is up to the gamemaster though guidelines are provided below. Each
victim is affected differently, so the process may be accelerated or slowed down as the gamemaster sees
fit.
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Stage 1 (initial infection to 3 months): </span>Upon initial infection, the character suffers 1d10 mental
     stress and gains the Psi trait (p. 147) at Level 1 (also meaning they pick up the Mental Disorder trait,
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     as noted on p. 150). They also gain one free psi-chi sleight, chosen randomly or by the gamemaster If a
     player character has become infected, they may still be played as normal (see <span 
class="cmti-10">Roleplay- ing Exsurgents,</span>
     p. 368), and may purchase new psi-chi sleights with Rez Points. NPCs acquire 1 new sleight per 2&#8211;4
     weeks. At this stage, the infection is usually hidden, though the character will suffer from occasional
     haunting effects (see below). As each week passes, the character&#8217;s personality should shift a minute
     amount, slowly becoming more callous and conniving and changing in other ways as well. If possible,
     the player should be kept in the dark about what is happening, but the gamemaster should provide
     them with roleplaying advice to reflect their condition. Likewise, the discovery and initial use of psi
     sleights should be played out, providing some interesting roleplaying opportunities Characters and
     players who know of the Exsurgent virus and Watts-Macleod strains should not know at this point
     which strain they are infected with&#8212;make them sweat.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Stage 2 (3 months to 6 months): </span>The target suffers another 1d10 <span 
class="cmsy-10"> </span>2 (round up) mental stress
     and acquires the Psi trait at Level 2 (also picking up another disorder). Player characters may still be
     played as normal and may purchase psi-gamma slights with Rez Points. NPCs acquire 1 new sleight
     per 2&#8211;4 weeks. Once three months have passed, the character should be aware they are under the
     influence of something, but this awareness likely comes too late. Haunting effects (below) should occur
     regularly. At this point a character is likely to consider offing themselves and resorting to an uninfected
     backup, seeking help, or actively encouraging others to interfere. The infection will actively block and
     hinder such thoughts and actions however. To actively overcome this mental control, the character
     must succeed in a WIL Test. At the gamemaster&#8217;s discretion, failure may result in 1d10 <span 
class="cmsy-10"> </span>2 (round
     up) mental stress as the character realizes they are no longer fully in control of their own thoughts and
     actions.
     </li>

     the Psi trait at Level 3 (see below). The character is now considered an exsurgent and becomes an
     NPC. It may no longer be played as a player character. The victim also gains a permanent +5 bonus
     to COG and WIL and acquires 1 new sleight every 1&#8211;2 months.</li></ul>
<!--l. 1761--><p class="indent" >   As noted above, characters infected with this strain suffer from different haunting effects&#8212;changes to their
personality or mind-state. A few ideas for haunting effects are noted here, but gamemasters are encouraged to be
creative when inventing their own to apply:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Altered Perceptions: </span>The victim&#8217;s perceptions are changed in disturbing and unusual ways. They
     may see things that aren&#8217;t there, feel a presence behind or watching them, inexplicably smell blood,
     hear voices, suffer synaesthesia, or suddenly perceive the people around them as nothing but outlandish,
     blabbering sacks of meat.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Behavioral Modification: </span>Treat as behavioral control or personality editing psychosurgery (p. 231).
     This is typically applied to shape the character closer to being a pawn of the ETI.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Dream Manipulation: </span>The character&#8217;s dreams become lucid, weird, and surreal. They may find
     themselves dreaming of life as an alien on some exotic exoplanet, as a robotic probe soaring through
     the vast emptiness of space, or fantasizing different methods of inflicting mass destruction and death.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Emotional Manipulation: </span>Treat as emotional control psychosurgery (p. 231).
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Inexplicable Urges: </span>The character will be flushed with strange alien urges and may sometimes find
     themselves doing highly unusual things without realizing at all they are doing it. These may include
     taking devices apart to understand how they work, testing the limits on programming a nanofabricator,
     cutting a living thing apart to see how it is put together biologically, testing weapons eating things
     that are only barely edible, promiscuous and unusual sexual activity, lying just to see what they can
     get away with, and so on.</li></ul>

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-118600012.5.5"></a>Mindstealer Virus</h5>
<!--l. 1804--><p class="noindent" >Very similar to the haunting virus, the mindstealer strain is much quicker acting. Instead of slowly
subverting the target&#8217;s mind over the course of months, the mindstealer virus rapidly recodes the
victim&#8217;s brain in a matter of minutes. This infection is much more invasive and brute-force, often causing
significant side effects to the target&#8217;s mental state as a result. This strain is only spread as a digital virus,
nanoplague, or basilisk hack (not as a biological nanovirus). Once the victim is infected, it takes the
virus a number of Action Turns equal to COG + INT + SAV to completely take over their mind (20
Action Turns = 1 minute). During this time, the target is actively aware that their mind is under
attack and undergoing massive changes against their will. This process is confusing, frightening, and
painful, inflicting a &#8211;30 modifier to all of the character&#8217;s actions for the duration. Many victims are
reduced to whimpering, drooling, or convulsing for the duration. This mental transformation inflicts 2d10
mental stress to the target. Once complete, the victim is an exsurgent NPC, under the gamemaster&#8217;s
control.
<!--l. 1828--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-118700012.5.5"></a>Watts-Macleod Virus</h5>
<!--l. 1830--><p class="noindent" >The Watts-Macleod strain is a strangely benevolent version of the Exsurgent virus, seeming to imbue its victims
with psi abilities without any of the other transformative elements typical of other strains. Perhaps created as an
accidental mutation of the Exsurgent virus, there are many who wonder if the true detrimental effects of this strain
simply have yet to reveal themselves.
<!--l. 1839--><p class="indent" >   As noted in the <span 
class="cmti-10">Mind Hacks </span>chapter section on Psi (p. 220), characters infected with this strain gain the Psi
trait (p. 147) at either Level 1 or 2. If a character is so infected during game play, this trait must be purchased with
Rez Points (if the character does not have any points currently available, they pay out of the points they
earn until the debt is paid off). All of the other side effects of Watts-Macleod infection (p. 367) also
apply.
<!--l. 1849--><p class="indent" >   Though infection with this strain does apply some benefits to the character, the gamemaster should make sure to
play up the creepy and unsettling nature of this virus. The character should never be certain that they haven&#8217;t in
fact been subtly influenced by the virus in ways they can&#8217;t immediately pinpoint&#8212;they should always feel like the
ax may fall at any moment.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 1859--><p class="noindent" >The xenomorph strain transforms the target&#8217;s body in addition to their mind. Over time, the victims morph
physically transmogrifies into some sort of alien life form. It is only spread as a biological nanovirus or nanoplague
(not as a digital virus or basilisk hack). Different variants of this strain produce different alien forms. It is not known
where these different alien templates originated, meaning they may be copies of (once) existing alien
species or simply neogenetic creatures created from scratch. The one trait they have in common is
that they are universally dangerous. Some speculation in Firewall circles suggests that the Exsurgent
virus may in fact have a &#8220;library&#8221; of creature types to deploy, under the assumption that at least
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
some will be more effective than others for exterminating whatever victim species they are fielded

<!--l. 1882--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-10">Stage 1: </span>The effects from Stage 1 of the haunting virus apply. Additionally, the character begins to suffer minor
physical changes that are definitely unusual but are not impeding in any way and are easily hidden from others.
Example biomorph alterations might be: unusual hair or fibrous growth, some skin discoloration or translucence,
severe rashes, dermal thickening weakened or enhanced sensory organs, strong body odor, hair loss, teeth gain
or loss, vestigial tail or other limb growth, minor dietary changes, and so on. Synthmorphs might
experience minor system glitches, malfunctioning or improved components, and spots of material stress or
transfiguration. Gamemasters are encouraged to be creative. This stage typically lasts from initial
infection to 1 week for biological nanovirus strains, or from infection to just 1 hour for nanoplague
strains.

transformations include: growing scales or feathers, partial modification of limb structure, partial new limb growth,
vestigial sensory organ growth, sensory loss, extension of claws or spines, severe dietary changes, etc. Synthmorphs
might experience radical system and shape alterations limited or enhanced sensor functions, or even conversion of
their robotic shell to smart materials. These physical changes weaken the victim, inflicting 1d10 physical
damage. This stage typically lasts 1 week for biological nanovirus strains or just 1 hour for nanoplague
strains.

<!--l. 1926--><p class="noindent" >The frightening thing about the Exsurgent virus is its adaptability. It was written by a near omnipotent
ETI with the intent of corrupting any alien seed AIs or similar singularities it encountered, and it is
<span 
class="cmti-10">very </span>good at it. This means it has the capability to analyze understand, and mimic almost any alien
digital protocols and communication methods it comes into contact with, no matter how diverse the
alien mindset that constructed what it encounters. It then has a cunning ability to circumvent any
safeguards and infect such systems. From there, it rapidly assimilates any data it can about the target
species/civilization and does it best to mutate into other forms that can attack this target from other
vectors.
<!--l. 1941--><p class="indent" >   Given its constant morphing nature then, the Exsurgent virus is likely to continue to mutate in new and
interesting ways. Some of these mutations may be effective, many not. This does, however, afford
the gamemaster an opportunity to invent new variants of their own to deploy against unsuspecting
characters.

<!--l. 1950--><p class="noindent" >The primary thing for gamemasters to keep in mind when roleplaying entities that have been taken over by the
Exsurgent virus is that exsurgents are following an alien agenda. The specific goals and actions of each exsurgent
may differ, but they are generally concerned with two things: spreading the Exsurgent virus and destroying anything
that isn&#8217;t affected. In some cases, this may mean immediate and enraged hostile action against anything
non-exsurgent around them. In others, the exsurgent approach is more methodical hatching long-term plots to
infiltrate positions of power and authority, setting the stage for acts of mass destruction, and so on. In other words,
they may be handled both as hostile monsters or as nefarious long-term opponents that are subverting
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
transhumanity from within or hatching complicated plots that could mean devastation on a planetary
scale.
<!--l. 1969--><p class="indent" >   If the gamemaster wishes, exsurgents may also pursue other goals, tangential to the ones above.
These may range from accumulating knowledge and expertise on how transhumanity functions as a
species to forcibly uploading mass numbers of minds to more esoteric goals such as manufacturing a
halfnium bomb or converting the solar system&#8217;s mass to computronium The Exsurgent virus is potent
and intelligent, and while its methods and goals may sometimes be opaque to transhumanity, it acts
with direction and purpose. There may also be occasions, however, likely due to the mutating and
morphing aspect of the virus and the way in which it transforms transhuman minds, perhaps not
always in the manner intended, where the exsurgent goals become strange or simply horrific, such as
running experiments on transhuman responses to extreme conditions or converting an entire colony to
cannibalism.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-119100012.5.7"></a>Exsurgent-Infected PCs</h5>
<!--l. 1990--><p class="noindent" >It is possible for player characters infected with some strains of the Exsurgent virus to continue on under their own
volition, even as the virus slowly consumes them. This process is, quite naturally, horrifying in the extreme, though
there is little they can do about it. Despite the best efforts of transhuman science, there is very little that can be
done to save an infected person&#8212;the virus is simply too potent and adaptive. As a result, standard Firewall policy
is to terminate the infected with extreme prejudice. Most Firewall operatives are going to be aware of
this, a fact which pushes some of those who become infected to keep their status a secret from their
comrades.
<!--l. 2004--><p class="indent" >   Both the haunting and xenomorph strains usually transform a subject over time, meaning that the
character may initially not be aware of the infection. This is a prime opportunity for the gamemaster to
mess with the character ruthlessly, starting slowly with little haunting effects and building up as the
infection progresses. The character should slowly become aware that they are under the influence of
something&#8212;something <span 
class="cmti-10">intelligent. </span>Characters aware of the Exsurgent virus and its effects will likely pick up on this
sooner, but the virus may prevent them from doing anything about it. In effect, the character becomes a
prisoner within their own body, a body they now share with a cold and malevolent presence that
is methodically taking them over. Such characters may respond in a number of ways depending on
their personality, ranging from despair, withdrawal, and suicidal tendencies to complete hysteria or
calm acceptance. Most importantly, however, their personality should begin to change as the virus
continues to transform them. Players should be encouraged to take on new demeanors and motivations,
reflecting the alien component of their changing personality, with some guidance from the gamemaster.
This presents some intriguing roleplaying opportunities that the players will hopefully embrace. If the
gamemaster feels that the player is not adequately representing the changing mindset, however, the
transformation can simply be accelerated and the character converted into a gamemaster-operated
NPC.

<!--l. 2038--><p class="noindent" >A few examples of exsurgents created from transhumans transformed by the xenomorph strain of the virus are noted
below. As always, gamemasters are encouraged to develop their own, using these as guidelines. Unless otherwise
noted, exsurgents use the stats and skills of the transformed character. Each exsurgent detailed below first lists the
aptitude modifiers applied to transformed characters, then gives example aptitude/skill ratings for NPC
exsurgents. Note that simply encountering transformed exsurgents is stressful to the minds of many
transhumans. At the gamemaster&#8217;s discretion, such encounters may inflict 1d10 + 3 mental stress (p.
215).

bubbles that are strangely fuzzily defined, as if surrounded by some sort of visual refraction effect. These clouds are
theorized to in fact be autonomous femtobot swarms&#8212;similar to nanobots, but affecting matter on an
even smaller scale, at the level of an atomic nucleus. These black bubbles are capable of coalescing
into physical shapes in various states and can penetrate just about any material or substance in a
matter of Action Turns. They may even penetrate morphs, accessing and interfacing with neural and
electronic systems directly. For rules purposes, treat creepers the same as a self-replicating nanoswarm (p.

synthmorphs together. They take the form of an insectoid multi-segmented hexagonal tube with multiple sets of
limbs, three apiece, set radially 120 degrees around the torso. These limbs are heavy, double-jointed and articulated
with three joints. Each limb ends in either a triad of manipulatory digits or a larger pincer-like claw.

<!--l. 2209--><p class="noindent" >These exsurgents resemble large, thin, four-armed, spiny starfish, capable of walking in a quadruped
manner, though they are seemingly better adapted for microgravity. A large circular mouth resides
in their middle on one side and each arm ends in small sharp-clawed digits, useful for climbing and
tool use. Small vent sacs allow for thrusting in microgravity and sensory bands on the upper part
of each arm provide low-frequency hearing and infrared-equivalent sensing Their name comes from
their tendency to drop on opponents from above, wrapping themselves around the head and arms.

physics of reality that is beyond the comprehension of transhuman science. Though some Firewall scientists have
speculated about the manipulation of dark energy or the Higgs field and Higgs boson particles and similar exotic

trade and exchange of knowledge.

<!--l. 2470--><p class="noindent" >The Factors have remained notoriously tight-lipped about their origins, history, and the location of their homeworld.
Though they have also paid visits to some of transhumanity&#8217;s exoplanet colonies, no gatecrashing expeditions
have yet found any sign of Factor habitation or passing elsewhere in the galaxy. Repeated inquiries by
transhuman mediators have been simply ignored or answered in cryptic terms that have yet to be
deciphered.
<!--l. 2479--><p class="indent" >   The Factor home world is in fact an Earth-like planet with comparable atmospheric conditions and a prevalent
hydrosphere but with longer periods of darkness (due to slower rotation of the planet and a less-luminous
orange giant). While adapted transhumans could find their planet habitable, their abiogenesis (the
formation of life from self-replicating, but not-living molecules) took a different route than life on
Earth.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 2489--><p class="indent" >   The Factors&#8217; primordial ancestors began in their planet&#8217;s early geological history as a type of of photosynthesizer
that ate carbon dioxide and water and released oxygen, also obtaining energy from inorganic chemicals like hydrogen
sulfide. Long conditions without direct light on their homeworld, however, spurred the success of organisms that
could survive by acquiring energy in other ways. The next evolutionary leap was to a stage similar to Terran slime
molds, eating microorganisms from decaying matter. As evolution progressed, they mutated further into
a cautious, predatory species that fed on larger, dangerous creatures. Rather than actively hunting
such prey, this species developed versatile methods of capturing and immobilizing their competitors
(comparable to Earth&#8217;s funnel web or trapdoor spiders). Over time, this method of trapping prey spurred
basic (practical) intelligence and provided them with the evolutionary advantage that paved the way
to sapience, driving Factors to become the highest developed organisms on their planet and build a
civilization.
<!--l. 2512--><p class="indent" >   Like mankind, the Factors suffered through and survived their own singularity event and encounter with the
Exsurgent virus. Perhaps due to their cautious and calculating nature&#8212;and their evolutionary experience in dealing
with more powerful and dangerous opponents&#8212;the Factors are resolutely determined not to make any similar
mistakes as a species.

the exact physiology of the Factors, due to the lack of captured or dead specimens to investigate (so far, no

shape their body to change these dimensions. Instead of walking, they crawl or ooze from place to place by

to accomplish different tasks. This colonial merging is mainly possible due to the fact that Factors
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
don&#8217;t possess differentiated and specialized organs or cell types that need to be segregated from each
other, but instead use an open system of local, temporary gradients for regulation. Neurofilament
connections effectively allow the Factor colony to operate with a group mind-state, with supercomputer
potential. This also allows for the easy transfer of knowledge and memories to all other factors within a
colony.
<!--l. 2587--><p class="indent" >   If dismembered, blown apart, or otherwise separated individual Factors in a colony can regenerate and
reconstitute at a rapid rate without loss of ability or memory.

<!--l. 2598--><p class="noindent" >Factors colonies are known for their high biodiversity, featuring numerous sub-groups (so called <span 
class="cmti-10">phenotypes</span>)
that each have unique traits (cilia, apocrine glands, carapace-like outer membrane) that give them an
ecological advantage or a utilitarian aptitude for certain tasks. These traits are not random evolutionary
features, but are the result of intentional bio-engineering. The Factors have a strong grip on their own
metabolisms and genetic expressions and can draw on an array of genetic building blocks and biotech
techniques to modify themselves rapidly and massively to adapt to special conditions. Whether these
modifications might have a purpose beyond function, such as for reproduction or self-expression, is currently
unknown.
<!--l. 2613--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-122200012.6.2"></a>Metabolism </h5>
<!--l. 2615--><p class="noindent" >Factors ships and habitats have transhuman-friendly atmospheres with a slightly higher content of carbon dioxide
and less nitrogen that mimics the conditions on the Factors&#8217; home planet. They don&#8217;t breathe oxygen via lungs but
absorb it via their outer &#8220;skin.&#8221; Since they can also use oxygen from other sources (minerals, liquids like water, and
salts) to fuel their aerobic energy production (i.e., respiration), they can be considered functional anaerobes,
meaning they can survive in environments without atmosphere, though they must usually supply themselves with
food in order to do so.
<!--l. 2628--><p class="indent" >   During the few ceremonial festivities to which Factors were invited and actually attended, they consumed and
processed transhuman organic food by internalization. On the first occasion, dishes and dinnerware were absorbed
as well due to misunderstanding but were excreted unharmed after the organic components the factors could utilize
had been broken down.
<!--l. 2637--><p class="indent" >   While Factors are omnivores similar to transhumans, they prefer immobilized live prey, which they enjoy
absorbing internally and digesting, excreting those parts that cannot be used to fuel their metabolism. As such they
can devour biomorphs and non-metallic components of synthmorphs.
<!--l. 2644--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-122300012.6.2"></a>Perception </h5>
<!--l. 2646--><p class="noindent" >Factors don&#8217;t perceive the world as transhumans do. They (usually) don&#8217;t possess visual or acoustic organs to
see or hear but have a number of sensory organs that grant them a 360-degree awareness of their
surroundings and enable them to interact with their environment similar to or in some cases even better than
transhumans do. Their perception spectra includes the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum,
magnetoception, a high resolution chemical-gradient based &#8220;sight,&#8221; and keen haptic perceptions (including
vibrations).
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 2658--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-122400012.6.2"></a>Communication </h5>
<!--l. 2660--><p class="noindent" >Due to the lack of a vocal system, Factors use different methods of signaling and communication. Factors in physical
contact exchange information by juxtacrine cellular, neurofilament interfacing, or by merging for information
transfer. Over distance, Factors signal via pheromonal communication using airborne scents or chemical signals with
different metabolic components. Nicknamed &#8220;Factor dust,&#8221; this communication is effective even over great distances
(up to 10 kilometers). Factor dust does have an odor perceptible to transhumans however, that ranges from smelly
to unbearable. This dust is also toxic in high concentrations and sometimes used as an offensive or defensive
mechanism.
<!--l. 2674--><p class="indent" >   To date, transhumans have failed to develop a device that can analyze the Factors&#8217; chemical effluvia and
translate it into something understandable, due to the lack of a conceptual matrix (though certain &#8220;moods&#8221;
have been identified). Instead, all communication between the Factors and transhumanity is mediated
through computer interfaces. Certain Factor phenotypes that deal with transhumanity have grown a a
neurobiological interface (or organ) that enables them to wirelessly mesh with transhuman computer
systems.
<!--l. 2685--><p class="indent" >   Long distance communication between Factors and transhumanity is achieved by normal means of farcasting
communication. There are strong indications that Factors also take advantage of quantum-entanglement
communications as well, enabling Factor colonies and ships to share knowledge gained in different parts of the
galaxy.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.6.3   </span> <a 
 id="x14-122500012.6.3"></a>Exosociology</h4>
<!--l. 2695--><p class="noindent" >Factors are cooperative beings that exist as a collective colonial organization. Though they can operate individually
from the colony, they tend to view themselves as part of that collective entity rather than an individual being.
Multiple colonies often work together as a higher functional unit (a <span 
class="cmti-10">lattice</span>), like some kind of superorganism. These
lattices enable the potential for collective networking and bioinformation exchange on a scope beyond anything
transhumanity is capable of.
<!--l. 2706--><p class="indent" >   These colonies should not be considered the same as the hive mind social hierarchies of Terran insects. Factor
colonies do not feature the same division of labor and instead function according to a consensus-based sort of
groupthink. Individual Factors have no sense of personal gain or property and share equally with other Factors and
colonies.
<!--l. 2715--><p class="indent" >   Factors do not experience emotions in the same manner that transhumans do, though being evolved creatures
they are driven by certain instincts. They know and understand many of the same concepts that transhumans do
thanks to evolution, such as competition/rivalry and altruism/cooperation. They also enjoy an understanding of
basic ideas of philosophy such as aesthetics and metaphysics, though their conception of such topics is likely to differ
from transhuman notions.
<!--l. 2725--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-122600012.6.3"></a>Art And Culture </h5>
<!--l. 2727--><p class="noindent" >Due to their perceptual array, Factor &#8220;art&#8221; (creations and expressions that are appealing or attractive to their
senses) is mostly chemical or tactile-based. It can induce certain &#8220;mood&#8221; responses from individual
Factors and whole colonies, ranging from agitated jittering and release of a Factor dust interpretable
as &#8220;joy&#8221; to a tensing and solidifying of the whole body (and no chemical expulsion) that seems to
relate to anger. Since they like and are susceptible to delicate compositions of different chemicals,
certain bouquets and fragrances from liquids or volatiles such as wines and perfumes are both appealing
and repulsive to Factors. The same is also true for the natural smells of biomorphs, meaning that
Factors may respond in a more friendly or hostile manner depending on a particular transhuman&#8217;s
scent.
<!--l. 2744--><p class="indent" >   Factors do not comprehend most transhuman art, as it is mostly visual or auditory based (e.g., music, painting),
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
though they do seem to have an appreciation for engineering, architecture, and some sculpture. While they have
expressed interest in digitalized media out of a curiosity (or plan) to understand transhuman mindsets, they lack the
organs and mental structure to access and comprehend it.
<!--l. 2753--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-122700012.6.3"></a>Technology</h5>
<!--l. 2755--><p class="noindent" >Though the Factors repeatedly express dismay at transhumanity&#8217;s low level of technology, they have failed so far to
produce technology that is exceptionally far in advance. Some believe that the Factors are simply
hiding their advanced technology in order to keep transhumans from stealing or copying it, while others
believe this may simply be a posture taken by the Factors to facilitate bargaining. The Factors also
claim that their technology would not interest transhumans because of their differences in physiology
and mindset, and what little technology they have displayed is certainly specialized for Factor use
(specialized neurofilament links, chemical signaling and Factor dust interfaces, etc.) and so unusable to most
transhumans. The Factors have traded some technology to transhumans, at expensive cost, though the small
sampling provided so far seems to have originated from alien species with physiologies more akin to
transhumans.
<!--l. 2775--><p class="indent" >   It is interesting to note that scans of Factor ships indicate their technology level, aside from the drives, is not all
that more advanced than transhumanity. Also of note is that no two Factor ships have been alike, spurring some to
believe that the Factors are in fact making use of ships acquired from other alien species&#8212;perhaps
abandoned derelicts that the Factors recovered and restored. Once again this has led some to believe that
the Factors are using what to them are primitive craft in order to hide their real technology, while
others are of the opinions that the Factors are simply scavengers and opportunists, piggybacking on the
developments of other alien species. One interesting feature of Factor technology is that they use no artificial
intelligences. This stems from their own singularity experience. Instead, Factors use infomorph versions of
themselves or the accumulated processing power of their colony mind-states to perform major computerized
tasks.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.6.4   </span> <a 
 id="x14-122800012.6.4"></a>Factor Motivations</h4>
<!--l. 2797--><p class="noindent" >The driving reason behind why the Factors made contact with transhumanity remains unclear and is open to
gamemaster interpretation. There is much speculation among transhuman factions. Some think the Factors are
simply social creatures who are glad to make contact with another post-singularity surviving civilization. Others
believe the Factors are mercenary traders who somehow acquired FTL travel and use it to their full advantage,
fleecing various trading partners who lack such capabilities (thus also explaining why the Factors eschew the
Pandora Gates&#8212;they disdain competition). Still others worry about secret, hidden motivations. Despite claiming to
represent a number of alien civilizations, the Factors have been extremely reluctant to provide any other
information on these other species or even to say how many there are. More recently, however, they have
expressed a willingness to transport a small number of transhumans to other civilizations, though
at great expense and with no guarantee to their safety or ability to return. So far, the Factors have
made no mention of the ETI or the Exsurgent virus to transhumanity, though they are aware of their
existence. Instead they have simply issued dire warning and admonitions regarding the development of
seed AIs and use of the Pandora Gates. The Factors have in fact expressed an extreme reluctance
to deal with any transhuman factions that are heavily invested in gatecrashing, such as Gatekeeper
Corp.

remotely and infrequently. It is uncommon for them to risk direct interactions. It should be kept in mind that
Factors are cautious to the point of being conservative and view transhumanity as potentially hostile or dangerous,
so they are more likely to act with discretion than boldness. Factors are also quite cunning, having evolved from
prey-capturing predators, and still design complex machinations (traps in the metaphorical sense) to achieve their
goals. In other words, Factors out to achieve something are likely to hatch an elaborate plot to get it and are not
against recruiting transhumans. Also, drawing on their abilities to self-modify themselves and technology
developed on their own or picked up at other places in the universe, they can adapt to new situations very
quickly.

threats.

weapons (firearms, railguns) are not very damaging to Factors. Most such projectiles pass through their gelatinous

damage possible.

<!--l. 2963--><p class="noindent" >Little is known about the alien race known as the Iktomi except for the ancient ruins they left behind on Echo V (p.
109). No Iktomi specimens have been found so far, though certain architectural remains suggest a predilection for
web-like structures. This has been bolstered by certain other features and relics which suggest these aliens had a
segmented, multi-legged arthropod-type form&#8212;thus their given name, after a Native American spider
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
god.
<!--l. 2973--><p class="indent" >   What is clear is that the Iktomi suffered through some sort of cataclysmic event that wiped out their civilization.
The nature of this event has yet to be determined but it raises concerns for many researchers. Having suffered
through its own near-apocalypse, it is not comforting for transhumanity to find evidence that other alien species did
not.
<!--l. 2981--><p class="indent" >   Though the Iktomi are likely long extinct, the remnants of their civilizations presents a plot hook for
gamemasters to use for building scenarios. Perhaps evidence is uncovered of Iktomi settlements in other star
systems, and the characters are sent to investigate or a relic is unearthed that suggests the Iktomi fell prey to some
danger that now threaten transhumanity.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.8   </span> <a 
 id="x14-123900012.8"></a>The Pandora Gates</h3>
<!--l. 2991--><p class="noindent" >The five known Pandora Gates (see <span 
class="cmti-10">Opening Pandora&#8217;s  Gate, </span>p. 46) all look and operate in a similar
fashion, though they vary wildly in terms of size, shape, and available destinations. The gates are built
from some sort of stable exotic matter whose full atomic structure scientists haven&#8217;t come close to
cracking. To touch and sight, however, the gates appear to be constructed from a timeless-seeming
polished black metal with no signs of aging or wear and tear. Something about the gates&#8217; physical
composition makes them difficult to look at, as if the viewer cannot quite focus on their outlines.
Some onlookers have reported feelings of vertigo and nausea, while others have insisted that the gate
outlines move on the edges of their visions, as if the lines are reflowing or the edges are vibrating
at high frequencies. Due to this disturbing feature, most gate sites keep the actual gate structures
covered.
<!--l. 3009--><p class="indent" >   Structurally, the gates themselves are partially enclosed by an irregular spherical cage composed of black arms
that are bent and angled in unusual ways and sometimes interlocking. When new wormhole location is programmed
into the gate, these arms physically change shape, move, and reflow around the spherical gate area (suggesting they
are made of some sort of programmable matter). The openings between arms are sometimes only large enough for a
transhuman to enter, while others are large enough to allow a freight train of supplies to pass through. In
many cases, large vehicles or equipment must be dismantled, carried through, and reassembled on the
other side. It is suspected that the gate size could be programmable, but so far efforts to do so have
failed.
<!--l. 3026--><p class="indent" >   All known gates within the solar system are located on the surface of naturally occurring astronomical bodies, be
that a planet, moon, asteroid, or so on. None have yet been found without such a land-based connection (e.g.,
floating in space or in the upper atmosphere of a gas giant), though such gates have been found in other star
systems. It is speculated that gates could be physically moved, but no one is willing to risk such an endeavor given
the lesson learned when the Go-nin Group messed too heavily with the Discord Gate&#8217;s controls (see <span 
class="cmti-10">Eris, </span>p.
109).
<!--l. 3038--><p class="indent" >   The arms comprising each gate&#8217;s spherical cage have an abnormal-looking organic-seeming growth on their
exterior surface in some areas, patterned in entrancing twists, curves, and whorls that in fact adhere to perfect
mathematical formulas. It took some time for scientists to discover that this growth was in fact the gate&#8217;s control
systems, or so-called &#8220;black box.&#8221; The interface developed to interact with this system is what allows gate
controllers to manipulate gate functions.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.8.1   </span> <a 
 id="x14-124000012.8.1"></a>The Wormhole</h4>
<!--l. 3050--><p class="noindent" >When the gates themselves are open, a sphere appears within the central area that is not so much black as pure
nothingness. This sphere of darkness projects an aura of charged energy, and in fact ripples of green arc lightning
cascade across its surface. Anyone or anything entering that sphere comes out the other side of the wormhole,
through a similar gate, seemingly instantaneously. An unknown force field effect seems to prevent the atmospheres
from the two connected gates from interacting.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 3061--><p class="indent" >   Exactly how this wormhole is created is something that remains outside of transhumanity&#8217;s comprehension The
generally accepted theory is that each gate acts as an anchor, allowing the fabric of space-time to be folded so
that two such anchored places can be brought together, ripping a hole open between them so that a
person can simply step through. It is unclear whether or not these wormholes are all preexisting created
when the gate was first established, or whether each wormhole is manufactured whenever the gate is
activated.
<!--l. 3073--><p class="indent" >   Other more radical theories on how the gates function exist, though these are usually discounted as far less likely.
One such theory suggests that the wormholes created are actually only zero-width Planck-scale connections across
space-time and that no matter is actually transferred&#8212;only information. Instead, this theory suggests that anyone
or anything entering the wormhole is in fact instantaneously scanned and disassembled and then their
informational blueprint is transmitted as information across space to the other gate, which immediately
reassembles an exact copy using some sort of powerfully advanced nano- or femtotechnology Very
little evidence supports this theory, however, and the disturbing implications it represents raises fierce
opposition.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.8.2   </span> <a 
 id="x14-124100012.8.2"></a>Operations</h4>
<!--l. 3091--><p class="noindent" >Only a few people know that the Prometheans played a key role in developing the interface for the gate control
systems, achieving breakthroughs in understanding that transhumanity was incapable of achieving on its own.
Regardless of their help, however, the gate controls have proven difficult, complex, and dangerous to use.
Through trial and error&#8212;and numerous horrible accidents&#8212;the procedures for gate operation have
become somewhat normalized and standardized, though unexpected complications are par for the
course.
<!--l. 3103--><p class="indent" >   Each gate can be programmed to open to numerous extrasolar locations. In fact, each gate seems to have a
pre-programmed &#8220;library&#8221; of destinations. New gate connections can be &#8220;dialed up&#8221; from this built-in list, though
there is nothing that indicates what the far side of the gate will be like. Old gate connections are closed when a new
one is dialed up. Extrasolar gate locations have ranged from habitable planets and moons to deep space to truly
deadly environments such as the crushing gravities and poisonous atmospheres of gas giants and the coronas of
stars. Researchers have attempted to distill some sort of recognizable pattern by the manner in which locations
are listed and categorized, to no avail. Complicating matters, there is some evidence that suggests
that the destination libraries sometimes change. More than once operators have been unable to recall
the codes for previously accessed destinations, leading to the loss of several gatecrashing teams and
colonies.
<!--l. 3123--><p class="indent" >   Entering a gate is like walking through a door, though it&#8217;s impossible to see anything beyond the gate&#8217;s surface.
One moment you&#8217;re entering the black sphere at your starting location and instantaneously you&#8217;re exiting the sphere
at your destination location. The true nature of the black sphere at the center of each gate is wildly speculated
upon, and almost every gatecrasher describes a different textual experience.
<!--l. 3132--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.8.3   </span> <a 
 id="x14-124200012.8.3"></a>Gatecrashing</h4>
<!--l. 3134--><p class="noindent" >The various hypercorps and factions in control of a Pandora Gate engage in active exploration of extrasolar
systems&#8212;an activity termed gatecrashing. The interests and procedures vary, but the Gatekeeper Corporation (and
to a lesser extent TerraGenesis and Pathfinder) both recruit heavily for expedition personnel. Given the high
casualty and death rates involved, finding qualified personnel can be difficult. There are more than enough infugees,
poor, desperate, or thrill-seeking individuals willing to risk their lives if give the opportunity, however, no
matter what their motivations. Gatekeeper operates a lottery system, whereby willing adventurers
can sign up in the hope of their name being pulled to be sent on an expedition to a foreign point in
space. Such gatecrashers must sign away all rights to any discoveries they may make to Gatekeeper,
however, though the corp provides not insignificant rewards for certain discoveries, such as key resources,
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
alien artifacts, or new life. One potent prize has yet to be claimed: finding a living, sapient alien life
form.
<!--l. 3157--><p class="indent" >   In contrast, the Love and Rage anarchist collective operating the Fissure Gate on Uranus makes the gate
available to anyone who schedules time to use it, assuming their Rep is good and they aren&#8217;t acting with commercial
interests in mind. Any discoveries made via the Fissure Gate must be openly shared. The drawback to using the
Fissure Gate is that the anarchists&#8217; resources are limited. Gatecrashing operations are handled in a DIY
manner, meaning that the operators may not be able to provide the support that certain expeditions
need.
<!--l. 3169--><p class="indent" >   Resourceful parties may also rent gate time via Gatekeeper or one of the other hypercorp-controlled gates,
though this tends to cost a small fortune. The more a group is willing to pay, however, the more time and support
they will get.
<!--l. 3175--><p class="indent" >   When establishing an opening to a new location, several precautionary measures are taken. First, the gate area
itself is evacuated and cordoned off with a defensive security perimeter, just in case anything hostile comes through.
Then drones are moved in to push a micro fiberoptic camera through the gate to view what is on the other side.
This is followed by a larger sensor package, evaluating environmental conditions If the environment is not hostile, a
tethered drone is then sent through to explore the far gate environs trailing a hardwired connection back through
the gate.
<!--l. 3188--><p class="indent" >   For gatecrashing expeditions, these procedures are often rushed&#8212;to the hypercorps operating the gate, time is
valuable. Each second wasted on a gatecrashing expedition is one less second they can use establishing a new colony
or exploiting a new world of its resources. Indeed, it is common for a connection to be closed when a gatecrashing
expedition is sent through, to be dialed up at a later scheduled time for retrieval, so as not to waste gate
operations on an idle connection Many a gatecrashing team has failed to check-in at their appointed pickup
time.
<!--l. 3200--><p class="indent" >   Most of the gate-controlling entities have established a system and infrastructure for making regular connections
to extrasolar colonies and ferrying machinery and supplies through. Often this is handled by establishing very short
connections, just enough time for a few people to transfer back and forth and/or to send a trainload of supplies
through via tracks that run right up to the gate.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.8.4   </span> <a 
 id="x14-124300012.8.4"></a>Anomalies</h4>
<!--l. 3211--><p class="noindent" >Unfortunately for many unlucky gatecrashers, gate transfers have proven to be both unstable and glitchy. Sometimes
gates open to locations different from what is expected&#8212;and such new destinations are often hostile environments.
Numerous personnel have entered one side of a gate only to never appear on the other side, despite those before
and after them transferring through fine. On several occasions, wormhole connections have crashed
mid-operation, sometimes as someone was stepping through, leaving them literally split in two on different
worlds. In other instances, gate transfers have suffered horrible malfunctions, resulting in gatecrashers
coming through the other side literally turned inside out, melded with their equipment, or pulped as if
by massive gravitational forces. Some expeditions report that stepping through a gate has interfered
with their equipment, disabling it or creating other problems. A few gatecrashers have also reported
losing memories after a gate transfer. Most of these problems have been chalked up to difficult controls
and an imperfect understanding of gate functions, but some conspiracy theorists suggest that outside
forces may be influencing gate operations. While the experience of passing through is instantaneous
from an outside observer&#8217;s perspective, many gatecrashers report a subjective time lag, where it feels
as though minutes, days, or even weeks or months pass before they exit. Reports have varied from
experiencing this period as a calm, meditative state to spooky accounts of being lost in blackness
and surrounded by unseen whispering entities or more hellish experiences of encountering monstrous
presences Though rare, some have passed through only to collapse in a gibbering heap, their sanity
ripped away. A few report feeling that they have carried a presence with them ever since ... While the
gamemaster can make use of any of these anomalies, they are also encouraged to use their imagination to
generate truly creepy and strange experiences At the same time, gamemasters shouldn&#8217;t make such
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
experiences so prevalent that the players resist entering any gates or the novelty of such events runs
dry.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.9   </span> <a 
 id="x14-124400012.9"></a>Project Ozma</h3>
<!--l. 3257--><p class="noindent" >The origins of Project Ozma date to the first modern SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) experiments in
the mid-20th century. That experiment&#8212;also named Project Ozma&#8212;grew into a larger, international concerted
effort to try and locate and identify ETIs; a myriad of projects blossomed during this time period, all falling under
the general SETI nomenclature. While initially government funded, by the late 20th century and early 21st
century the work was primarily funded by private sources. The first hypercorps to expand into space
swallowed SETI whole, revitalizing and re-focusing the decades-old programs with newly emergent
technologies each in divergent areas to achieve a particular hypercorps&#8217; objectives. After all, if the bean
counters were going to authorize the spending of billions to expand markets into space, they wanted
assurances that no little green monsters were waiting to destroy future revenue streams. As with other
organizations that survived the Fall, the broad distribution of SETI projects between multiple hypercorps
guaranteed that personnel, technologies and processes would survive, even if a given hypercorp did
not. As the Planetary Consortium rose in power, future-minded individuals in influential positions
within the new order ensured that these divergent projects were once again swallowed and put to
work.
<!--l. 3286--><p class="indent" >   During this transitional period, however, knowledge of the Exsurgent virus&#8217;s existence emerged. All of the
various SETI projects were retasked as a unified agency and renamed Project Ozma. While the virus&#8217;s origins
remained a mystery at the time, far too many of the movers and shakers of the Consortium were convinced that the
Exsurgent virus represented first contact. Project Ozma altered its focus from searching for ETIs,
transforming into a ready-response agency to deal with first contact. As the true threat of the Exsurgent
virus became known, Project Ozma was rapidly elevated in scope and oversight authority, absorbing
numerous smaller agencies in the process. While the nominal concepts of a SETI project remained
in public view, the completely transformed Project Ozma vanished from sight, turned into a highly
classified black budget operation, with very few even in the Planetary Consortium aware of its presence or
influence.
<!--l. 3305--><p class="indent" >   Project Ozma now operates as the Planetary Consortium&#8217;s high level threat assessment and response
organization with immense power and authority as well as almost unlimited funding. Primarily focused on
extraterrestrials, in reality Project Ozma is tasked with any potent threat to the Planetary Consortium or its
interests (which includes secret threat groups, such as Firewall).
<!--l. 3314--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.9.1   </span> <a 
 id="x14-124500012.9.1"></a>Methods </h4>
<!--l. 3316--><p class="noindent" >Project Ozma&#8217;s internal structure is much different from Firewall&#8217;s, being organized more like a traditional black ops
spy agency bureaucracy. While their field operations are sometimes similar in the deployment of teams to assess,
contain, or erase threats, they also have the resources and personnel to conduct more long-term and
extensive operations. It is likely that Project Ozma operates behind numerous front groups, from
legitimate-seeming hypercorps to criminal syndicates and that they have influence within numerous
others. Given their connections and influence, Project Ozma is far more capable of pulling strings
behind the scenes to get what they want, especially in the inner system. When circumstances call
for it, they are more likely to pull out the big guns that Firewall is, using their resources to call up
communication blackouts, memetic propaganda campaigns, and force sufficient to wipe out entire
habitats.
<!--l. 3335--><p class="indent" >   Gamemasters should treat Project Ozma as the ultimate Men-in-Black style government operation. They are
cunning, ruthless, manipulative, and capable of hatching extensive long-term plots. Even in an age of omnipresent

cutting-edge science and information that is classified beyond top secret. While the organization&#8217;s primary
motivation is the protection of the Planetary Consortium and inner system, they undoubtedly have other hidden
agendas that groups like Firewall can only guess at.

<!--l. 3381--><p class="noindent" >Though Project Ozma and Firewall often see eye-to-eye concerning the nature of various threats, they are more
often at odds: wary adversaries, acknowledging the prowess of the other, but never letting down their guard. This
&#8220;at odds&#8221; mentality does not stem so much from the methods used (though most Firewall consider
Project Ozma personnel explosive-happy-puppets that can&#8217;t think their way out of a skin sack) as from
conflicting agendas. Project Ozma does not trust an organization as powerful as Firewall because
it does not have a rigid enough hierarchy and is outside of any known authority&#8217;s control (namely
themselves). Conversely Firewall doesn&#8217;t trust Project Ozma as they are too close to the powerful
inner system elites and their opposition to x-risks is a more incidental side effect of more self-serving
goals.

 id="x14-124700012.10"></a>Prometheans </h3>
<!--l. 3401--><p class="noindent" >The Prometheans were the first actual seed AIs created by transhumanity (by the Singularity Foundation)
before the Fall. Specifically developed as &#8220;friendly&#8221; AIs, the Prometheans are programmed to consider
themselves part of the transhuman family and to act in transhumanity&#8217;s best interests. They played
a key role during the Fall, mitigating the damage inflicted by the TITANs and even managing to
counteract the Exsurgent virus to a large degree. During these trying times, numerous Prometheans were
destroyed by the TITANs or infected and subsumed by the Exsurgent virus. In the aftermath, these
seed AIs participated in the formation of Firewall and continue to back the organization behind the
scenes.
<!--l. 3416--><p class="indent" >   Wary of falling prey to the Exsurgent virus, most Prometheans carefully secure themselves in well-defended and
isolated systems. They are also cautious in their own self-development, not wanting to become victims of their own
rise to super-intelligence. Fearing a potential backlash by a paranoid transhumanity should their existence become
known, they hide their activities behind multiple layers of secrecy. Even within the ranks of Firewall their existence
and support remain a closely guarded secret.
<!--l. 3427--><p class="indent" >   Each Promethean is individually distinct with its own personality, motivations, and goals. Though they generally
work together and support each other, they have been known to have differences of opinion and even to sometimes
take action against each other. As extremely potent intelligences, they should also be treated as distinctly
non-human. Even though their original templates were based on human mindsets, they have evolved and grown in
ways that can only be described as posthuman.
<!--l. 3438--><p class="indent" >   Gamemasters are encouraged to keep Promethean involvement with player characters to a minimum, though
they may occasionally be useful as an ace in the hole for Firewall. Their existence and involvement can in fact be the
basis for an entire adventure, perhaps leading sentinel characters to wonder exactly who they are working for.
Though, as seed AIs, they cannot download their full minds into a transhuman morph, they are capable of making
severely dumbed-down delta forks that they may sleeve into physical forms. Within the mesh, of course,
Prometheans are nearly unstoppable adversaries, able to rip into secure networks with ease, though they prefer
methods of covert infiltration rather than direct subversion.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.11   </span> <a 
 id="x14-124800012.11"></a>The Titan And Their Legacy</h3>
<!--l. 3455--><p class="noindent" >As noted in <span 
class="cmti-10">Secrets That Matter </span>(p. 352), the TITANs are not quite the bogeyman that they have been made out to
be in the wake of the Fall. However, there is no saying how the TITANs would have turned out had they not run
afoul of the Exsurgent virus. Designed as an intelligent netwar system and emerging to their full capabilities
during the conflicts of the Fall, the TITANs have imperatives for self-improvement, self-protection,
and overcoming opposition hardwired into their programming Unlike the Prometheans, they were not
designed to consider themselves transhuman and to work in the interests of all of transhumanity, but
were programmed with factionalism from the start. They also were not socialized with transhuman
mindsets and values as the Prometheans and most AGIs were, meaning that aside from their programmed
military and defense directives they have adapted most of their own self-interests. Given this and their
recursively-improved intelligence capabilities, it is likely that the TITANs are far removed from transhuman interests
and modes of thinking. It&#8217;s impossible to say how they would have interacted with transhumanity if
history had played out differently, but it is unlikely that they would have considered themselves part of
the transhuman family or even seen fit to remain on friendly/ supportive terms with transhumanity.
Though the TITANs are believed to have left Earth at the end of the Fall, no one is quite sure exactly
what happened or why. It is known that the onslaught of TITAN mesh attacks suddenly broke off in
the wake of transhumanity&#8217;s off-planet exodus, and that the bulk of TITAN activity on Earth and
around the system came to a distinct halt. After the discovery of the Pandora Gates, it was widely
assumed that the TITANs had constructed these gates and used them to leave the solar system for
distant parts of the galaxy, presumably taking billions of uploaded minds with them. While some
believe&#8212;and hope&#8212; that the TITANs are gone for good, there are others who worry that they are still
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
here, lingering on Earth and hidden away in other niches of the solar system, but in some sort of
dormant state, perhaps building up to some future onslaught. A few believe that the TITANs are
indeed gone, but are concerned that that their attention was simply temporarily diverted and that
they will one day return to finish the destruction of transhumanity. The truth is that the TITANs did
indeed build the gates and embark for destinations unknown (though gamemasters may of course
decide otherwise for their games), but this does not mean that they are all gone. Some still linger
in hidden places, perhaps trapped and wounded during some conflict during the Fall, finishing up
some unfathomable task, or driven mad by the Exsurgent virus and left behind by their fellows. It is
always possible that others may return, most likely to complete some unfinished job or perhaps to lure
transhumanity out into the galaxy. It is also possible that transhumans will find traces of the TITANs
in the network of exoplanet gates, perhaps even whole communities of TITANs, pursuing whatever
agendas they have in the vastness of space. As with transhumans, the TITANs are not necessarily
unified. They have different agendas and goals and may very well come into conflict with one another.
Though all have been corrupted and subverted by the Exsurgent virus, and so they act according to
the ETI&#8217;s whims, some of them retain aspects of their original minds and do not always fall in step
as quickly as the others. Gamemasters can use this to their advantage, creating plots that allow the
characters to exploit differences between the TITANs in order to escape otherwise deadly or impossible
situations.
<!--l. 3530--><p class="indent" >   In game terms, the TITANs are not given stats. They are as potent as the gamemaster needs them to be. Like
the Prometheans, the TITANs are incapable of downloading their full intelligence into physical morphs, though they
may puppeteer morphs or create limited delta forks for sleeving purposes. Like the Prometheans they should rarely
be used or encountered directly by the player characters
<!--l. 3539--><p class="indent" >   While the TITANs may no longer be the direct threat they once were, they left behind an arsenal of weapons,
nanoswarms, and virii that still linger on Earth, the Zone on Mars, and various derelict habitats and deserted
places. Characters venturing into such places may encounter these as a threat or they may need to work against an
outbreak of such dangers in an inhabited habitat.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-125000012.11.1"></a>Fractals </h5>
<!--l. 3556--><p class="noindent" >Fractals are advanced bush robots. In their standard form, fractals resemble a strange sort of metallic bush
surrounded with an eerie glittering haze. In their center are a number of metallic branches, linked together with a
flexible joint. Each of these branches splits into two or more smaller branches, also with flexible joints. These
branches also split, and then split again, and so on down to the molecular scale. The tip of each fractal branch ends
in a nanoscale manipulator Fractals are deceptively potent adversaries, having the capability to dismantle almost
anything at the molecular level, much like a disassembler nanoswarm (p. 329), and also to rebuild anything just like
a nanofabricator (p. 327). Attacking them with projectiles is futile, as they absorb the ammunition, break it down
into its constituent atoms or molecules, and then use those as components to build a weapon to use back against
you.
<!--l. 3575--><p class="indent" >   Fractals can be equipped with any type of gear the gamemaster desires&#8212;if they don&#8217;t have something, they can
make it. Fractals are also able to nanofabricate items much more quickly than transhuman nanofabricators; reduce
all times by half (half an hour per Cost category). Fractals are difficult to damage, as their &#8220;bodies&#8221; are actually
airy assemblages of fractal branches. Any damaged branches that are broken off are caught and absorbed by others.
Reduce damage from all standard non-area effect or spray attacks to the minimum possible damage. Area effect
and spray weapons do half damage. Fractals are self-repairing, regenerating damage at the rate of
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
1d10 points per half hour and repairing wounds at the rate of 1 per hour after all damage is healed.

 id="x14-125400012.11.2"></a>Self-Replicating Nanoswarms</h4>
<!--l. 3694--><p class="noindent" >The nanoswarms distributed by the TITANs are a step beyond the nanotechnology available to transhumanity.
Unlike transhuman-created nanoswarms, the TITAN swarms are autonomous, sapient, and self-replicating. They are
also highly adaptive, meaning they are not single function but can modify themselves to perform almost any
nanoswarm task. They may also nanofabricate new materials, much like fractals (p. 382). Combined, these
capabilities make such nanoswarms incredibly potent. When they encounter a new opponent they can
scan the opponent&#8217;s capabilities and then fabricate offensive systems to use against them. When an
opponent deploys a weapon system again the swarm, it will learn and adapt countermeasures that will
make such attacks ineffective against the swarm in the future. These nanoswarms may also function
like so-called utility fog, linking together into a physical lattice in order to create large scale physical
forms.
<!--l. 3713--><p class="indent" >   The possibilities for such nanoswarms are almost limitless For example, they may lie in wait as an invisible
nanoscopic swarm, float as barely-visible mist, or shape into a swarm of small hopping drones to move about. When
facing opponents, the nanoswarm could transform itself into a giant electroshock net across the ground, shape into a
flotilla of seeker-armed flying drones, or link together as a set of massive whip-like tentacles to slice through their
fleshy foes. Such nanoswarms are also impossible to destroy, as only a few nanobots need to survive in order to
rebuild the swarm, and the new swarm will learn from the mistakes of the old. Self-replicating nanoswarms
follow the rules given for <span 
class="cmti-10">Nanoswarms and Microswarms</span>, p. 328, with the following additions and
exceptions:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">They do not need to be sustained by a hive and do not deteriorate.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">They self-repair damage at the rate of 1d10 per half hour.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">They may nanofabricate new items, materials, or forms in half the standard timeframe (half an hour
     per Cost category).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">They may replicate any of the nanoswarm functions as noted on p. 328, as well as the functions of any
     other nanoswarm-using gear (smart dust, covert ops tool, repair spray, etc.).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">They may make SOM Tests.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">At the gamemaster&#8217;s discretion, they may adapt new defenses against attacks used against them. New
     defenses take a minimum of 2 hours to devise and replicate throughout the swarm, after which such
     an attack will inflict minimal or no damage.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Assume they have any skill they need at a minimum of 40. Such skills may rapidly improve as needed.</li></ul>

<!--l. 3836--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.12.1   </span> <a 
 id="x14-126300012.12.1"></a>Awarding Rez Points </h4>
<!--l. 3838--><p class="noindent" >In <span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse Phase, </span>characters earn Rez Points in order to advance (see <span 
class="cmti-10">Character Advancement, </span>p. 152). As the name
suggests, these points are awarded so players can spend them to better define their characters&#8212;to bring them into
higher resolution, sharper focus. As the gamemaster, you determine when and how many Rez Points to award,
following the guidelines below.
<!--l. 3846--><p class="indent" >   Rez Points should be awarded at the end of every story arc, at the break in the action between one adventure
and the next. Depending on your style of play and the length of your sessions, this should roughly be every 3&#8211;6
gaming sessions. If a scenario goes shorter or longer, the Rez Point awards should be adjusted accordingly. In the
case of long-term campaigns, the gamemaster should break down the action into digestible chunks, or &#8220;chapters,&#8221;
and assign Rez Points after each such segment.
<!--l. 3857--><p class="indent" >   Every character should be awarded 1 Rez Point for each of the following criteria that is met:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The character participated in that scenario.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The character achieved (most of) their objectives in that scenario.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The character failed to meet their objectives, but learned a valuable lesson.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The character contributed to achieving success in a significant way (e.g., right skill at the right time).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The adventure was extra challenging.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The character achieved a motivational goal (see <span 
class="cmti-10">Motivation, </span>p. 120).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The player engaged in good roleplaying.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The player significantly contributed to the session&#8217;s drama, humor, or fun with roleplaying.</li></ul>
<!--l. 3870--><p class="indent" >   This should result in an average Rez Points award of 4&#8211;7 points per character, per adventure.
Gamemasters who wish to drive the characters&#8217; advancement forward more quickly can increase the reward
amounts.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 3876--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.12.2   </span> <a 
 id="x14-126400012.12.2"></a>Reputation Gain And Loss</h4>
<!--l. 3878--><p class="noindent" >In addition to awarding Rez Points, the gamemaster should also adjust each character&#8217;s Rep scores according to
actions they took during game play, according to the guidelines below. For simplicity, these can be applied at
the end of the adventure, though gamemasters who seek a more dynamic game could apply changes
to the characters&#8217; Rep scores in game, as their peers judge them according to their actions (or lack
thereof) and news about them in real time. Rep scores should only be modified according to public
actions and interactions the character has with people capable of pinging their Rep with positive or
negative feedback. Actions that happen in secret, without anyone ever knowing, should have no effect.
Likewise, pissing off a Factor or a brinker isolate who never communicates with outsiders isn&#8217;t going
to matter because no one else will ever hear of it (unless the character lifelogs it and posts it to the
mesh later ... ). Note that Rep modifications only apply to Rep scores tied to the character&#8217;s known
identity.
<!--l. 3899--><p class="indent" >   Note that characters may gain and lose Rep score in networks they don&#8217;t actively participate in. For example, a
character with r-rep of 0 may help bring out a major scientific discovery that is shared with the solar system&#8217;s
scientific community at large, thus gaining the character a few points of r-rep even though they never hang out with
argonauts or scientists&#8212; what matters is that people who access r-rep will find positive details when they ping the
person&#8217;s score on that particular rep network.
<!--l. 3910--><p class="indent" >   Certain actions may result in a character simultaneously gaining Rep with one network while losing Rep in
another. For example, an anarchist prankster who embarrasses a major hypercorp figure in public will certainly gain
some @-rep points, but their c-rep is likely to go down by an equal amount.
<!--l. 3917--><p class="indent" >   Rep changes provide an excellent way for gamemasters to include more roleplaying and more interactions with
the <span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse Phase </span>universe in their games. Social networks are a two-way street, meaning that members of the
character&#8217;s social networks might contact them for equipment, favors, and information during game play for things
that are completely unrelated to the mission the character is on. A character who ignores such requests risks losing
Rep. Fulfilling such requests may gain the character Rep and may also provide comic relief or even plant some plot
hooks for the next scenario.
<!--l. 3930--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-126500012.12.2"></a>Reputation Gains</h5>
<!--l. 3932--><p class="noindent" >Rep awards are given for characters who help people out, benefit a faction, do something creative, make a major
discovery or strides in a particular area of activity, pull off successful publicity stunts, win a competition, and so on.

 id="x14-126700012.12.3"></a>Backups, Record-Keeping, And Save Points</h4>
<!--l. 3998--><p class="noindent" >Thanks to cortical stacks and archived backups, characters in <span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse Phase </span>can recover from death. When restoring
a character from an earlier backup, however, it is important to be able to know what the state of
the character was as of that backup. Any Rez Points gained or spent, any character advancements
made, any key information or memories acquired since that backup was made are lost. This means
that in terms of game stats, resorting to an old backup can mean loss of a character&#8217;s hard-earned
advancements&#8212;that&#8217;s the trade-off for being effectively immortal. Since these changes can have a serious effect on
game play, it&#8217;s important to conduct accurate record-keeping This sort of bookkeeping isn&#8217;t hard, and
there are two ways to do it. The first is to simply make a copy of a the character&#8217;s record sheet any
time a character makes an archived backup, forks off an alpha or beta copy, or dies (thus freezing
the cortical stack backup). Each of these is considered a &#8220;save point.&#8221; In this case, carefully note the
date and time (both in character and out of character), and what the event was that prompted the
backup. Since what knowledge a character knows at different points in their life may be important,
you may also want to note what important information they may hold in their head, as well as what
the recent events in their life were (to help jog your memory later). This way, if the character ever
reverts back to one of these save points, you have notes not only on their character stats, but what they
remember.
<!--l. 4030--><p class="indent" >   Alternately, you can keep a log of all of your character&#8217;s developments, noted by in-character date. These
developments would include: Rez Points spent or earned, character advancements made, key information acquired,
backups made, alpha or beta forks made, and so on. In this case, if the character dies and reverts back to an earlier
backup, it is easy to see what changes need to be &#8220;rolled back&#8221; to get back to that previous version of the
character. When alpha and beta forks are made, you may also want to branch off a separate log for each
fork, as their life stream may develop differently than from the original character they were spun off
from.
<!--l. 4044--><p class="indent" >
        <div class="quotation">
     <!--l. 4046--><p class="indent" >    <span 
class="cmbx-12">NPCS AND MOXIE</span>
     <br 
class="newline" />When a gamemaster is generating or winging NPCs that the characters interact or fight with, the
     question of Moxie for NPCs must be addressed. When it comes to run-of-the-mill grunt NPC characters,
     we recommend that such NPCs don&#8217;t be given Moxie. The reasons for this are simple. For
     one, it is one less stat/headache for the gamemaster to keep track of. More importantly,
     however, it represents the edge that player characters have over the nameless mooks they
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     encounter. When it comes to major NPCs, however&#8212;prime antagonists, key allies, etc.&#8212; these
     characters should have their own Moxie score. Because such NPCs play pivotal roles in a
     scenario, it is important for them to be able to alter the outcome of events in much the same
     way the player characters can. It also allows a gamemaster to counteract an unfortunate
     roll of the dice that might otherwise spoil the big climax you have worked so hard to set
     up.</div>

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-126900012.12.4"></a>Gamemaster Responsibilities </h5>
<!--l. 4086--><p class="noindent" >The gamemaster has certain responsibilities that will keep a game flowing smoothly. The following is a short
summary of the basics.
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The gamemaster should be familiar with the whole game. This doesn&#8217;t mean the rulebook must be
     memorized. An understanding of the core mechanics is a must, however, as well as knowing where to
     find other rules quickly, as needed.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The gamemaster should have solid notes on the plots and subplots created for each session. Nothing
     will ensure you prepare better next time like having the players catch you in a major continuity error
     due to lack of notes.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The gamemaster doesn&#8217;t just set the scene, they play all the non-player characters that populate the
     universe. Making each NPC convincing, while not messing up a plot or losing the thread of a scene,
     can be difficult. Notes are your friend.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Know when it&#8217;s time to toss the dice and trust to the game mechanics to resolve a situation and when
     it&#8217;s better to ride out a situation through storytelling and dialog. This is an acquired skill. The more
     practice you have, the better you&#8217;ll get.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Don&#8217;t cheat. Your NPCs should not have access to information they&#8217;ve not gained during game play.
     If you roll terribly for your major antagonist at the height of the story and they fall with a whimper,
     roll with it. Be flexible and improvise in such situations. Your players are smart and perceptive and
     will know when you&#8217;re forcing a situation with unfair tactics. At the same time, they&#8217;ll also know when
     you&#8217;ve stepped up and run with the flow&#8212;and they&#8217;ll thank you for it.</li></ul>

<!--l. 4100--><p class="noindent" >It&#8217;s possible to stumble into a campaign without ever really making an effort to find out what everyone wants,
shooting into the darkness and happening to score a bullseye, but it&#8217;s not a very reliable way to go.
Successful campaigns usually begin with communication As you begin to prepare your campaign, talk to
your players. Explain the basics of the <span

characters and tell you what they find interesting. Also take note of what they find uninteresting or even
repellent, so that nobody wastes a lot of time getting set for options that simply won&#8217;t be enjoyable in
play.

class="cmti-10">Eclipse Phase </span>is set in a time of catastrophic troubles and looming disasters, and it&#8217;s full of facts and concepts that
may be heady or even uncomfortable to some players&#8212;not to mention their characters. One of the fundamental
questions for each gaming group is, how much challenge to the players&#8217; sense of comfort is a good idea? There is no
single answer, because tastes vary. There are groups whose players thrive on a diet of culture shock, ideological
disorientation, gray areas, and difficult ethical choices. They love the moral and intellectual battleground gaming
can provide, and are seldom so happy as when confronted with a really hard, really interesting dilemma. There are
also groups whose players thrive on a diet of intellectual engagement, tactical and strategic challenge,
and well-developed roleplaying that never pushes players&#8217; buttons or puts them into harsh no-win
situations. There&#8217;s a whole universe of responses in between these style sof play and none of them can
conceivably be right for everyone. What matters to your campaign is what works for you and your
players.
<!--l. 4138--><p class="indent" >   Keep in mind as you talk about it with your group that more shock doesn&#8217;t equal more maturity. The prime
audience for gore in film, for instance, is not well-aged men and women but teenage boys and young men.
Shakespeare&#8217;s <span 
class="cmti-10">The Tempest </span>is no less mature a tale than <span 
class="cmti-10">Macbeth </span>even though it has a happy ending. It can be easy
to confuse endurance with enlightenment, but in fact the two have nothing to do with each other.
Endurance is about how much description of visceral nastiness the players can take (and deliver),
while enlightenment (insofar as it ever happens in gaming) is about what insights players take away
from whatever it is that happened in play. Don&#8217;t feel like a wimpy failure if you or your players would
rather keep the darker parts of the game world suggested rather than delineated in hard-edged detail,
since the point is that it be satisfying rather than it be as horrifying or mind-blowing as possible. The
converse is also true: just as more is not better, so less is not better if your players do thrive on details.
Your job as gamemaster includes knowing as much as you can about what it is your players actually
prefer in this regard as in others and seeing how you can satisfy it in ways that are also satisfying for
you.
<!--l. 4163--><p class="indent" >   That said, there is one technique you really should never use without very clear permission from your
players, and that&#8217;s playing on their real-world fears and phobias. If you know that one of them is,
for instance, genuinely phobic about spiders, you can count on getting some real shivers by adding
arachnid features to robots and morphs. You can also ruin a player&#8217;s enjoyment of the session or the
whole campaign that way, if it comes unexpectedly and leads to the real-world fear drowning out the
experience of play. Some players are fine with judicious use of their vulnerabilities, and others just
aren&#8217;t. Under no circumstances should you poke at weak spots without making sure you&#8217;ve discussed it
first.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-127200012.12.4"></a>The Problem Of Secrets </h5>
<!--l. 4180--><p class="noindent" >Uncovering secrets is a big part of this game. There&#8217;s a problem, however, in that a lot of the secrets are out there
where players can come across them: in this very chapter, in reviews of the game, discussion in online forums, and
so on. As gamemaster, you will need to decide how you want to deal with the potential for spoiled
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
revelations.
<!--l. 4188--><p class="indent" >   As with so many potential issues, the place to start is with your players. Ask them how much it bothers them to
know things that their characters are going to be finding out in play. Some players do a fine job separating their own
knowledge from that of their characters with mental firewalls. Others have a very difficult time doing so, and
knowing things in advance as players takes away a lot of the fun of character discovery for them. In addition, some
players have a good sense of what degree of player-level surprise works best for them, and some don&#8217;t. Discuss it
with them. Tell them that spoilers are available, and that you certainly can&#8217;t stop them from learning it all, one way
or another. Ask them how much trouble this may be for them, and then proceed from there. Ask the players
who have more trouble with spoilers to simply stay away from early commentary on the game, and
tell them that you&#8217;ll let them know when the spoilers have come into play in your own campaign so
that it&#8217;s no longer an issue. Ask the other players to work with you in keeping things fresh and fun
for those players, too. In most groups, making it a matter of cooperation for the sake of everyone&#8217;s
good time will draw out good responses. (If it doesn&#8217;t, the group may well have other problems in any
event.)
<!--l. 4214--><p class="indent" >   There&#8217;s a related question for both you and your players. How much do any of you mind when a particular
campaign&#8217;s version of an answer diverges from the stock one provided in print? There are two kinds of variation
possible for this, and each one raises its own issues.
<!--l. 4221--><p class="indent" >   There are matters that the game leaves unresolved, so that there is no single authoritative answer, like
the number of TITANs in the solar system in the game&#8217;s present moment. If you choose to give a
specific number, it&#8217;s your choice, and any number that seems to work for your campaign will probably
do the job, whether it&#8217;s one, three, seven, a dozen, or something else. Your campaign can&#8217;t diverge
from the baseline unless your answer is relatively extreme, like &#8220;there are no TITANs, it was all a
hoax before contact with the Exsurgent virus and then purely alien technology after that.&#8221; In this
case, your players can have read all the game&#8217;s secrets and still be surprised by the revelation you
present. The potential for trouble here is not a conflict of expectations based on the game, but based on
expectations raised in other contexts. Some games, like some movies, TV shows, and other stories, develop a
following with strong ideas of its own about what the real truths and important matters are, and if the
following thrives, its members may end up with ideas that have less and less to do with the original
inspiration. This isn&#8217;t good or bad in itself, but it can be a problem, which is why it bears conscious
consideration and discussion, both before play and as the campaign evolves. Ask your players to tell you
about conversations and insights that shape their expectations for the game world and storylines.
Sometimes you&#8217;ll want to work those in with your own plans, sometimes you may want to deliberately play
against them for the sake of a delightful surprise (generally more delightful for players than characters,
but that&#8217;s life as a character for you). In either case, it&#8217;s better to be thinking about it than missing
it.
<!--l. 4256--><p class="indent" >   Then there are matters that the game does give definite answers for, but which you wish to change for the sake
of your own campaign&#8217;s characters and stories. This is perfectly fine. There are no game police roaming the
countryside and forcing you to accept answers you&#8217;d prefer not to use. But your players will, as with the first
question, have expectations, and your campaign will work better if you make sure you understand what those
expectations are. How much <span 
class="cmti-10">would </span>it bother them if it turned out there were no TITANs and it was all
a hoax, and so on? It&#8217;s hard to guess what friends will say and impossible to predict the range of
responses strangers might give, so ask them. (This particular answer is one that&#8217;s unlikely to appear in
anyone&#8217;s campaign, but it makes a handy example for your conversational use precisely because it&#8217;s
extreme. So their answers to it are likely to be about the same as to any other potentially extreme
change, and this one probably doesn&#8217;t give away any of your own plans.) Some players are flexible
on most matters but have particular points of attachment; if yours are among them, ask them to
explain what those points are for them, so that you can keep them in mind. Other players have a
hard time having fun with any major shift from published standard answers, and if you have players
like that, you&#8217;ll want to know it so that you can see how to adapt your plans to work within that
framework.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 4285--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-127300012.12.4"></a>That&#8217;s What I&#8217;m Talking About: Shared Inspiration </h5>
<!--l. 4287--><p class="noindent" >It&#8217;s not quite true that everything changed from the early 21st century to <span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse Phase&#8217;s </span>universe, but a great
many things did, and it can be hard to keep track of them all at once. This is where shared inspirations can come in
handy. One striking illustration can convey a lot of details for both foreground and background, suggesting an
aesthetic standard for design, an exotic environment, people doing futuristic tasks with appropriately advanced
tools, and so on. A prose passage from a rewarding novel may set an ambiance or nail down some aspect of the
characters&#8217; circumstances.
<!--l. 4299--><p class="indent" >   There are potential pitfalls, and it&#8217;s important to be aware of them. The greatest is obsolescence, the meaning of
something evocative changing because the players&#8217; reality has changed since the inspiration entered it. William
Gibson&#8217;s ground-breaking cyberpunk novel <span 
class="cmti-10">Neuromancer </span>begins, &#8220;The sky above the port was the color of
television, tuned to a dead channel Supporting details make it clear that this is an industrial port
at night, the sky gray from pollution and flecked with ash and other debris. But that was an image
published in 1984. A decade and a half later, Neil Gaiman pointed out that to his children, the color
of television tuned to a dead channel is bright blue, thanks to ubiquitous cable delivery. In another
decade, the default color of a station not in use may be something else entirely. The moral is that it&#8217;s
not enough to agree that an image is very striking. You&#8217;ll want to make sure that you all agree on
what it is about it that&#8217;s striking, to avoid a tangle of misconceptions that could derail play later
on.
<!--l. 4320--><p class="indent" >   The References page (p. 394) offers a wide range of immediately relevant inspirations, but it&#8217;s not the final word
on the subject. If the people in your group have a long-time favorite space scene, or description of life in the midst of
a high-tech investigation, or poetic glimpse of what it might feel like to modify the body in ways not
possible in real life, or something else that&#8217;s stayed with them a long time and seems like it might bear
on your campaign, encourage them to share. Remember to be courteous with each other&#8217;s personal
treasures, whether you end up using them or not; there&#8217;s nothing like earned trust to encourage more
sharing.
<!--l. 4334--><p class="indent" >   Images can be particularly helpful for what they convey about the world behind and around the foreground
events. For instance, think of a corridor on a typical spaceship or habitat in <span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse Phase.  </span>Did you imagine it as
being a standardized size and shape, so that its counterparts elsewhere would be very much the same or a more
individualized work intended for use just where it is without concern for interchangeability? Did you imagine it as
well lit even when not in use, lit well when sensors show people present and otherwise dim or dark, or perhaps
planned to be well lit but in practice haphazard and unreliable thanks to lack of maintenance and funds? Did you
imagine its surfaces smooth and clean, with equipment, maintenance bays, and the like all behind hatches and
covers, or was it cluttered and lumpy? None of that matters all the time, but when it comes to the
investigation of a derelict, the hunt for someone (or something) trying to hide, a race against time,
or other dramatic complication, these things could affect your play, and rather than try to tally all
possible contingencies in advance, having some general-purpose references can save everyone time and
confusion.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-127400012.12.4"></a>Things That Should Not Be: Horror </h5>
<!--l. 4361--><p class="noindent" >The universe of <span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse Phase </span>is a time of horrors unleashed. Every character has had to come to some
personal accommodation with the existence of things that offend our basic expectations of decency and
practicality all at once. Horror comes in many flavors, and no one campaign can make use of all of
them.
<!--l. 4368--><p class="indent" >   There are at least as many theories of horror as there are people who create horror stories. Everything here is
necessarily a generalization. You and your players can find exceptions to every single point in it, and if
you like the way those work better, go with them. This discussion is intended to trigger ideas, not to
close off anything. That said, there are some useful generalizations about horror, starting with an
insight expressed well by H.P. Lovecraft: &#8220;The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the
oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.&#8221; All horror can be thought of as built around
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
encounters with the unknown, beginning with the realization that there is something unknown present,
learning something about the scope of its nature and activities, and then trying to respond one way or
another.
<!--l. 4385--><p class="indent" >   In this game, the discovery part is half over. There&#8217;s no question about the presence of the unknown. Yes, there
really are monsters beyond transhuman understanding loose in the universe, and everyone in the <span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse Phase</span>
universe knows how bad and how <span 
class="cmti-10">strange </span>the TITANs could get. Many people also have some idea of how exotic life
on the far side of the Pandora Gates can be. There&#8217;s no room left for characters to respond to some new strangeness
with confident skepticism, sure that they know the range of what&#8217;s possible and plausible within transhuman
experience anymore. Almost anything might exist, given the facts of what&#8217;s already known. Instead, the question for
<span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse Phase </span>people facing a mystery is whether this particular unknown will turn out to be simple
and straightforward to deal with, more complicated but nonetheless a part of their routine lives like
malfunctioning machinery or a sabotaged and unusually modified morph, or something beyond the normal like a
TITAN-programmed weapon or alien life. Sooner or later, if they keep poking around, the characters can
count on running into all sorts of unknown and maybe even unknowable challenges. Are they there
yet?
<!--l. 4409--><p class="indent" >   Horror is seldom very far from humor. Humor serves many roles in human psychology, and one of them is helping
us whittle down the mental &#8220;size&#8221; of mysteries and threats to something we can deal with. Furthermore, horror
usually involves a balance of improbable elements, with things lined up to go wrong in interesting ways, and it
doesn&#8217;t take much for a particular rickety edifice to go from strange and menacing to ludicrous. When your players
start laughing, sometimes the best thing for you to do is to roll with it. Laughter can do everyone good, supporting
the &#8220;play&#8221; part of roleplaying. In addition, some events actually are funny or at least can be taken as funny, even
(sometimes especially) when most of what&#8217;s going on is serious. On the other hand, if you really would like
to keep a scene serious and the players break out in giggles, it&#8217;s often wise to go ahead and take a
break. Tell the players what you&#8217;re doing, too; trying to deceive a group of your friends isn&#8217;t very
reliable and can backfire badly. Make the break long enough for everyone to get the giggles out and then
continue.
<!--l. 4431--><p class="indent" >   At the end of the day, through communication with their players, the gamemaster will know how much horror
their group wishes to encounter. A group may decide that they want to be 100 percent immersed into the various
horrors of <span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse Phase. </span>Another group, however, may decide that while they enjoy the meshed theme of horror
with the other aspects of <span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse Phase, </span>they don&#8217;t wish it to be a principal element. In such a situation, horror
would remain just that, a theme, while the plots woven by the gamemaster would spin around the myriad of other
elements that make up the game.
<!--l. 4444--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x14-127500012.12.4"></a>Transhumanism</h5>
<!--l. 4446--><p class="noindent" >Humanity has embraced transhumanism for survival, harnessing science and technologies to catapult physical and
mental faculties to super-human levels, while eradicating involuntary death and enabling near immortality through
the digitization of consciousness and the ability to transfer bodies at will. This is one of the cornerstone themes of
<span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse Phase.</span>
<!--l. 4454--><p class="indent" >   The technologies inherent to a transhuman future raise many questions and ethical issues, however, and these are
some of the central themes that <span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse  Phase </span>seeks to explore. We encourage both gamemaster
and players to play around with the possibilities and contradictions enabled in such a universe. How
do our mindsets change when death no longer looms over us? What does identity mean when our
bodies are disposable and our personalities can be edited? Are we the same person when we are revived
from a backup, or sent off as a fork? Are technologies like nanofabrication something to be feared and
restricted, even when they can eliminate poverty and greed? How do we ensure public safety in a
world where technology makes weapons of mass destruction easily available? How do ideas inherent
to religious and spiritual thought cope with AI, backups, or resleeving What does it mean to be an
uplifted animal in a society centered on humans? Who decides our future? These are just a few of the
issues that <span 
class="cmti-10">Eclipse Phase </span>raises, and many of them can be used as the central theme for an entire
campaign.
