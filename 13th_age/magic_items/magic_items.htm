True magic items are permanent magic items used as loot during adventures and rewards for success. One-use items (mainly potions, oils, and runes) are magical treasure on which to spend hard-won gold. (See Loot: Treasure Rewards for notes on the wealth successful characters earn each adventure.)</p><h2><span id="chapter-1-sh1"/><span id="b2"/><span class="c1">One-Use Items</span></h2><p class="s1 c2">The common types of one-use items include potions, oils, and runes.</p><h3 class="c3"><span id="chapter-1-sh2"/>Potions</h3><p class="s1 c2">You can buy potions that fall in the tier of the environment you’re in. You can carry as many potions as you wish. Drinking a potion takes a standard action, even if you don’t have it in hand already. Feeding a potion to an unconscious ally is also a standard action.</p><p class="s1 c2">You can only be under the effect of a single potion at a time. If you’re using a potion that has a lingering effect, drinking another potion ends the first effect. Non-healing potions tend to have effects that last until the end of a battle, or around five minutes if you’re prepping for a battle and drinking potions beforehand.</p><h4 class="c2">Healing Potions</h4><p class="s1 c2">A healing potion lets the creature drinking it heal using one of their recoveries. Potions provide bonus healing on top of what you’d generally get with a recovery, but there’s a hit point cap for the maximum healing you can get from a potion, no matter how well you roll your recovery.</p><h4 class="c2">Healing Potion Costs</h4><table class="s2" style="margin-left:0.0px;width:54.2%;border-collapse:collapse"><col style="width:25.9%"/><col style="width:17.0%"/><col style="width:38.6%"/><col style="width:18.6%"/><tr style="height:20.0%"><td class="s5 s3 s4 c2">Tier</td><td class="s6 s3 s4 c2">Cost</td><td class="s6 s3 s4 c2">Effect</td><td class="s7 s3 s4 c2">HP Cap</td></tr><tr style="height:20.0%"><td class="s8 s3 c2">Adventurer</td><td class="s9 s3 c2">50 gp</td><td class="s9 s3 c2">Recovery +1d8 hp</td><td class="s10 s3 c2">30</td></tr><tr style="height:20.0%"><td class="s11 s3 c2">Champion</td><td class="s12 s3 c2">100 gp</td><td class="s12 s3 c2">Recovery +2d8 hp</td><td class="s13 s3 c2">60</td></tr><tr style="height:20.0%"><td class="s8 s3 c2">Epic</td><td class="s9 s3 c2">200 gp</td><td class="s9 s3 c2">Recovery +3d8 hp</td><td class="s10 s3 c2">100</td></tr><tr style="height:20.0%"><td class="s11 s3 c2">Iconic</td><td class="s12 s3 c2">300 gp</td><td class="s12 s3 c2">Recovery +4d8 hp</td><td class="s13 s3 c2">130</td></tr></table><h4 class="s14 c2">Potion of [Energy] Resistance</h4><p class="s1 c2">When you drink one of these potions, you gain resistance to a single specified energy type dealt by creatures or hazards of a specific tier for the rest of the battle or for five minutes. Resistance from a potion is always 16+. Attackers of the tier covered, or lower, must roll a natural 16 or higher on their attack roll to overcome your resistance and do full damage of a type you’re resistant to, otherwise they deal half damage. Damage from a source that’s a higher tier than your potion ignores your resistance. See Resistance. For the types of resistance available, see Other Damage Types.</p><h4 class="c2">Resistance Potion Costs</h4><table class="s2" style="margin-left:0.0px;width:37.2%;border-collapse:collapse"><col style="width:37.8%"/><col style="width:37.5%"/><col style="width:24.7%"/><tr style="height:25.0%"><td class="s5 s3 s4 c2">Tier</td><td class="s6 s3 s4 c2">Resistance</td><td class="s7 s3 s4 c2">Cost</td></tr><tr style="height:25.0%"><td class="s8 s3 c2">Adventurer</td><td class="s9 s3 c2">Resist 16+</td><td class="s10 s3 c2">100 gp</td></tr><tr style="height:25.0%"><td class="s11 s3 c2">Champion</td><td class="s12 s3 c2">Resist 16+</td><td class="s13 s3 c2">200 gp</td></tr><tr style="height:25.0%"><td class="s8 s3 c2">Epic</td><td class="s9 s3 c2">Resist 16+</td><td class="s10 s3 c2">400 gp</td></tr></table><h3 class="s14 c3"><span id="chapter-1-sh3"/>Oils</h3><p class="s1 c2">While potions affect creatures, magic oils affect items. Oils provide temporary magical enhancement to weapons, armor, and spellcasters’ implements.</p><p class="s1 c2">It’s a quick action to pour magic oil on your weapon, implement, or armor. The effect lasts until the end of a battle or for five minutes before fading.</p><p class="s1 c2">Each oil confers a bonus of +1 (adventurer), +2 (champion), or +3 (epic). Used on a weapon or a spellcasting implement, the bonus applies to attack and damage rolls. Used on armor, the bonus applies to AC.</p><p class="s1 c2">Bonuses from oils don’t stack with magic items’ inherent bonuses.

What that rapport means varies from item to item and is usually controlled by the GM. Some items talk with their user. Others communicate in bursts of emotion or slight motion.</p><p class="s1 c2">Each item has a personality that is largely defined by its quirk. What you can count on as a default is that nearly all magic items want to be used and used well.</p><p class="s1 c2">As an adventuring hero, you can handle a number of true magic items equal to your level. Items one tier above you count as two items, and epic items count as three items if you are an adventurer tier character.</p><p class="s1 c2">If you are carrying and wielding a number of items that is equal to or lower than your current level, the magic item personality quirks will tug at you, giving you sudden urges and desires that will feel natural to give in to. But you’ll be in charge.</p><p class="s1 c2">If you are carrying and wielding a number of items that is greater than your current level, the magic item personality quirks are going to have more power over you. You’re no longer running the show; instead, the magic items are, to some extent, running you. Herein lies a roleplaying challenge for the player and the GM.</p><h2><span id="chapter-1-sh7"/><span id="b5"/><span class="c1">Chakras</span></h2><p class="s1 c2">You can only have one of each type of magic item (or one pair, for boots and gloves).

You can count on using a recharge power once a day, but subsequent uses depend on successful recharge rolls. After the battle in which you’ve used an item’s power, roll a d20. If your roll equals or exceeds the recharge number for that item, you can use that item power again that day.

Owning the bottle gives you +2 bonus to Intelligence-based skill checks, if you have the time (and privacy) to consult the lore bottle. Chances are, your particular lore bottle has some sort of specialty or bias, which you will discover only through use. Unlike most magic items, lore bottles can often be found for sale, but you probably don’t want those. Quirk: The connection formed with the face in the bottle can be compelling and unsettling, as the spirit literally “gets in your head.” Each bottle has a different effect on its owner.</p><h4 class="c2">Dwarven Mug</h4><p class="s1 c2">One in four mugs of ale you drink from this mug will be magically transformed into the very finest non-magical dwarven ale. If your relationship with the mug is good, the variety might even suit your current mood and the odds of getting a good brew might improve in your favor. But really, who’s going to complain about putting down a second, or even third, mug for the chance to get a taste of the best stuff? When that excellent ale does show up, you can share a sip or two with a friend, but other attempts to capitalize on this mug’s magic will just shut it down until it can find a more suitable owner. Quirk: Speaks in dwarven, especially while drunk, even if ordinarily unable to speak dwarven.</p><h4 class="c2">Rope of Entangling</h4><p class="s1 c2">Fifty feet of fine, spidersilk rope, woven so closely that it seems like a solid, flexible cable. Once you attune the rope during a full heal-up, you can make it entangle things with standard action commands. In combat, it’s not that useful, because it’s slow compared to a living thing. If the target is stationary, however, the rope excels at reaching, climbing, snaking, coiling, and entangling. You might be able to get the rope to bind a ferocious monster, but the rope is likely to get destroyed in the process. Quirk: Speaks in sentences for which “convoluted” is the only proper term.</p><h3 class="c3"><span id="chapter-1-sh30"/>Cursed Magic Items</h3><p class="s1 c2">Cursed items can be useful, though all of them have significant drawbacks.</p><h4 class="c2">Adventurer</h4><h5 class="c2">Blade of Unerring Panache</h5><p class="s1 c2">(+2 weapon)</p><p class="s1 c2">When you attack with this weapon and miss, you lose 4 hp (champion: 10 hp; epic: 25 hp).

If the spell targets one enemy, deal +4d10 damage. Otherwise, deal +2d10 damage. In addition, the first time you take damage each battle, you lose 20 hp.</p></div></body></html>
